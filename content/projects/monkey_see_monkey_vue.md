[`monkey-see-monkey-vue`](https://github.com/SKalt/monkey-see-monkey-vue/commits/master) exposes methods for finding events that Vue.js will react to. It's still a work in progress.

Inspired by the excellent [`gremlins.js`](https://marmelab.com/gremlins.js/) and [_Generating Software Tests_ by Zeller et al.](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/).
