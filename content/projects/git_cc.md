a <abbr title="Terminal User Interface">TUI</abbr> for creating conventional commits.

<!--more-->

`git-cc` helps write conventional commits inside your existing workflow:

- you can use `git-cc` to interactively guide your commit-writing or invoke it to validate your commits.
- `git-cc` ships as a standalone binary for Linux, Mac, and Windows.
- you can invoke it as git cc with similar flags as `git-commit`
- respects `$EDITOR` and the editor configured for `git-commit`

While it's free for personal use, you can get a license for commercial use for $5 via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/skalt/sponsorships?tier_id=365645).
