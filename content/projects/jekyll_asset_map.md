A set of jekyll `_includes` that allow you to use hashed assets from webpack or another asset wrangler in Jekyll without a plugin.
Since Github pages don't allow custom plugins, this is the closest you'll get to using `rails-webpacker` in Jekyll.

**UPDATE**: As of [2022-08-10](https://github.blog/2022-08-10-github-pages-now-uses-actions-by-default/), you can build your GitHub pages with customized jekyll or other static site generators using GitHub actions.
