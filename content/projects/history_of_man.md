Someone once told me to <abbr title="Read The Fucking Manual">RTFM</abbr>.
I wanted to, but since this is software engineering, you can't just "read the manual", that'd be too simple.

<!-- note on m4 -->

I've been informed that there might be an easier way to RTFM but I'm pretty sure that'd be illegal.
These same informants told me that "writing everything in `bash` wasn't neccessary" and they're right, but it's too late for that. Far too late.

Anyway, if you want a dataset of HTML versions of the man pages, you can get 'em here.
The dataset might be useful for building tools like [explainshell][explainshell] or doing interesting analyses like ["The growth of command line options, 1979-Present" by Dan Luu][cli-complexity].
