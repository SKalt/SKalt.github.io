TL;DR:

- do research
- state what you know
- ask factual questions

My personal recipe for a good **debugging** question is:

1. what I observed that surprised me (e.g. something **specific** not working)
1. state hypothesis (e.g. what I thought might be wrong)
1. how I tested the hypothesis (e.g. what docs/people I consulted, what tests I ran -- and the results I got!)
1. either where to look next or alternate hypotheses
