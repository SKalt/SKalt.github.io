Someone told me to <abbr title="Read The Fucking Manual">RTFM</abbr>.
I wanted to, but since this is software engineering, you can't just "read the manual", that'd be too simple.
Either you open twenty Stack Overflow tabs searching for a magical flag or you compile every linux man page from source into HTML.
I've been informed that there might be an easier way to RTFM but I'm pretty sure that'd be illegal.
These same imformants told me that "writing everything in `bash` wasn't neccessary" and they're right, but it's too late for that. Far too late.

Anyway, if you want a dataset of HTML versions of the man pages, you can get 'em here.
The dataset might be useful for building tools like [explainshell][explainshell] or doing interesting analyses like ["The growth of command line options, 1979-Present" by Dan Luu][cli-complexity].
