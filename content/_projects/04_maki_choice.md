Mapbox provides an excellent selection of symbols for map-making with its
Maki icon set. Unfortunately,
[their page](https://www.mapbox.com/maki-icons/) doesn't provide
a search function.
That's why I built a quick Vue app, [`maki-choice`]({{ page.link }}) to help me search and select icons for mapmaking.
