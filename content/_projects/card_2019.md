My 2019 holiday card.
I took inspiration from pixel art such as [the Living Worlds series](http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/).
The view is of my apartment.

Writing this card was a bucket of fun, especially learning the HTML canvas api and figuring out how to get the snowfall to wrap around when it hit the edge.
My favorite part of building this card was probably working with [Zeit `now`](now.sh)'s immutable deployments.
