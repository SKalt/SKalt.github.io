Computer programs are essential in allowing for this great diversity of applications. In this course, you will learn to create your own programs, based on core programming concepts and analytical problem solving approaches. You will develop dynamic programs by first using using JavaScript and Unity, the technology behind many mobile apps and games. The last portion of the course will teach you Java, a popular modern programming language. We assume no prior study of computer science.
