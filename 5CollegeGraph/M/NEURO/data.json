This course focuses on three broad fields in neurotechnology: optical methods for examining neural activity and structures, innovations in electrophysiology, and mind-machine interfaces. Specific topics may include: optogenetics, 2-photon microscopy, 'brainbow' imaging, methods for single ion channel recording, and neuroprosthetics. Presentation, discussion, and critique of research articles will form the core of the course. As a culminating experience, students will write mock grant proposals for experimentation based on techniques discussed in class.\nPrereq: Biological Sciences 220.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n91054,91150\n91150\n \n ","Department Code":"NEURO","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2015/SPRING/NEURO/321TC/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(121, 252, 62)","size":10.0},{"label":"NEURO-295","x":4.0,"y":0.0,"id":"1","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study","Description":"Spring\n2016\nNeuroscience & Behavior\n295\nMount Holyoke College\n1.00-4.00 credits.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n95655\n \n ","Department Code":"NEURO","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2016/SPRING/NEURO/295/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(121, 252, 62)","size":10.0},{"label":"NEURO-309ST","x":5.0,"y":0.0,"id":"2","attributes":{"Title":"The Neurobiology of Stress","Description":"Spring\n2016\nNeuroscience & Behavior\n309ST\nMount Holyoke College\nIn this seminar, students will gain a thorough understanding of the stress response system, referred to as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Using primary literature, the course will cover various facets of the HPA axis, including the cellular and anatomical neuroscience behind the stress response. Students will gain an understanding of the techniques commonly used to assess acute and chronic HPA axis activity and behavioral reactivity in humans and in a variety of non-human animals. We will explore how genes and the environment interact to determine how an individual will respond to a stressor and examine irregular activity of the HPA axis in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Anxiety, Depression, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\nThis course is offered to neuroscience majors only.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n95536\n \n ","Department Code":"NEURO","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2016/SPRING/NEURO/309ST/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(121, 252, 62)","size":10.0},{"label":"NEURO-295P","x":6.0,"y":0.0,"id":"3","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study W/ Practicum","Description":"Fall\n2014\nNeuroscience & Behavior\n295P\nMount Holyoke College\n1.00-4.00 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n90589\n \n ","Department Code":"NEURO","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2014/FALL/NEURO/295P/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(121, 252, 62)","size":10.0},{"label":"NEURO-100L","x":7.0,"y":0.0,"id":"4","attributes":{"Title":"Intro to Neuroscience Lab","Description":"Spring\n2016\nNeuroscience & Behavior\n100L\nMount Holyoke College\nThis course is limited to first-year students.; Coreq:  NEURO-100.\nMultiple required components--lab and/or discussion section.
