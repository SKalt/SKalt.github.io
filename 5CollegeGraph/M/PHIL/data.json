What are the responsibilities of individuals, particularly individuals living in relatively affluent societies, to prevent climate change, and to alleviate the harms caused by it? How should we act to prevent war, and should we ever initiate wars in order to prevent greater evils (such as genocide)? What responsibilities do citizens of relatively affluent nations have to prevent and ameliorate poverty and global inequality? In order to reason clearly about these questions, we will need to think deeply about the notion of global citizenship (or cosmopolitanism) and the nature of individual moral responsibility.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n89566\n \n ","Department Code":"PHIL","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2014/FALL/PHIL/260GE/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(20, 202, 46)","size":10.0},{"label":"PHIL-103","x":7.0,"y":1.0,"id":"24","attributes":{"Title":"Comparatve Intro to Philosophy","Description":"Spring\n2016\nPhilosophy\n103\nMount Holyoke College\nWhat kind of life should a person live?
