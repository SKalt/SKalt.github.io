Students will develop and apply traditional and contemporary architectural skills (sketches, plans, elevations, models, computer diagramming, and various modes of digital representation) to interdisciplinary and socially pertinent design problems. Creative and indexical study and analysis will be used to generate and foster a broad range of concepts and language to solve architectural issues involving site, construction, inhabitation, function, form, and space. Our goal is to apply creative techniques in art and sculpture to the creation of meaningful space.\nStudents enrolled in this course will be responsible for some of the cost of materials.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n93142\n \n ","Department Code":"ARCH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2015/FALL/ARCH/205AD/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(67, 202, 199)","size":10.0},{"label":"ARCH-395","x":1.0,"y":0.0,"id":"1","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study","Description":"Spring\n2016\nArchitecture\n395\nMount Holyoke College\n1.00-8.00 credits.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n95639\n \n ","Department Code":"ARCH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2016/SPRING/ARCH/395/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(67, 202, 199)","size":10.0},{"label":"ARCH-225ED","x":2.0,"y":0.0,"id":"2","attributes":{"Title":"Interm.: Environmental Design","Description":"Spring\n2016\nArchitecture\n225ED\nMount Holyoke College\nThis hybrid studio addresses human comfort with lectures and problem work sessions integrated with design projects. We start with an in-depth study of the world's climate regions, the sun, and the earth's tilt and spin. Primary methods of heat transfer are investigated as students research two architectural solutions (vernacular and contemporary) within each climate. Using daylight, the sun's movement, and sun-path diagrams students will design, draw and build a functioning solar clock. Issues in day-lighting and thermal comfort will then drive an extended design problem. Students will be asked to solve numerical problems and present design solutions using both drawings and models.\nPrereq: 4 Credits in Architecture design studio.\nStudents enrolled in this course will be responsible for some of the cost of materials.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n94762\n \n ","Department Code":"ARCH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2016/SPRING/ARCH/225ED/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(67, 202, 199)","size":10.0},{"label":"ECON-349FR","x":3.5,"y":1.0,"id":"3","attributes":{"Title":"Forecasting","Description":"Spring\n2016\nEconomics\n349FR\nMount Holyoke College\nIn this course, students will learn time series forecasting theory and methods for Business and Economics.

The computer is used in its capacity as a design tool, encompassing both digital skills and design thinking. Skills with 3D modeling and 2D visualization softwares are developed through a series of cumulative design exercises. Prototypes are generated using plotters, laser cutters, and 3D printers to confront the reality of virtual constructions. Design discourse is introduced through complementary lectures, readings, and discussions.

Students will develop skills of speaking and writing about architecture, while also learning basic design tools: the sketch, map, plan, elevation, materials study, and landscape setting. Guest architects and theorists will introduce design topics and work with students preparing drawings and designs that are evaluated on effort and realization, not on proficiency.\nThis course is limited to First-year and Sophomore students.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n95512\n \n ","Department Code":"ARCH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2016/SPRING/ARCH/201/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(67, 202, 199)","size":10.0},{"label":"ARCH-295","x":7.0,"y":0.0,"id":"6","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study","Description":"Spring\n2016\nArchitecture\n295\nMount Holyoke College\n1.00-4.00 credits.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n96491\n \n ","Department Code":"ARCH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2016/SPRING/ARCH/295/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(67, 202, 199)","size":10.0},{"label":"ARCH-211","x":3.0,"y":0.0,"id":"7","attributes":{"Title":"ARCH-211","Description":"not offered in the last 4 semesters","Department Code":"ARCH","Course Site":"","Requisite":""},"color":"rgb(67, 202, 199)","size":10.0},{"label":"ARCH-220","x":4.0,"y":0.0,"id":"8","attributes":{"Title":"ARCH-220","Description":"not offered in the last 4 semesters","Department Code":"ARCH","Course Site":"","Requisite":""},"color":"rgb(67, 202, 199)","size":10.0}]}
