We will view movies from Central America and South America, including Brazil, in order to look at the way that contemporary Latin American cinema has addressed neocolonial class, race, gender, and sexual prejudices in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. In addition to discussing the way that films have addressed the need for social change in Latin America, we will think about how their messages extend globally. The course will be conducted in Spanish.
