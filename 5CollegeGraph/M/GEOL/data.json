We will also examine the development of feminist theory, including its promises and challenges.\nThis course is limited to Geography and Geology majors and minors\nCourse meets on Fridays just after the 'Earth Adventures at Lunch' talks.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n93258,93249\n93258\n \n ","Department Code":"GEOL","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2015/FALL/GEOL/399/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(43, 253, 134)","size":10.0},{"label":"GEOL-103","x":21.0,"y":0.0,"id":"19","attributes":{"Title":"Oceanography","Description":"Spring\n2016\nGeology\n103\nMount Holyoke College\nBecause more than seventy percent of our planet is covered by oceans, the study of marine systems is crucial to our understanding of Earth History and life on the planet.

We will explore how the Earth's oceans formed, how they provided the foundations for life, and how they continue to affect weather and climate, stabilize global chemical cycles, erode coastlines and provide access to resources.

In this course we study these processes (e.g. glaciers,rivers,slopes, coastlines, arid regions, frozen ground, cave formation, soil development and groundwater) to understand how they work and to understand the resulting landforms and deposits. With this understanding we can then observe different landforms and deposits and infer past processes (environments of deposition).
