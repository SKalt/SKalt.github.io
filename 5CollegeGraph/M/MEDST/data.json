Exploring the medieval desire to know, this course considers how the period's tendencies toward spiritual and metaphysical thought are balanced against its fascinations with the observable world. We will study the ways allegories, travel narratives, romances, and dream visions intersect with natural philosophy, historiography, cartography, and architecture. Literary analysis is the basis for our investigative work to uncover the epistemological impulses that inform medieval art and literature.\nPrereq: A first-year seminar.\nmeets English department pre-1700 requirement\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n95579,95143\n95579\n \n ","Department Code":"MEDST","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2016/SPRING/MEDST/217CM/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(28, 14, 67)","size":10.0},{"label":"MEDST-295","x":1.0,"y":0.0,"id":"1","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study","Description":"Spring\n2016\nMedieval Studies\n295\nMount Holyoke College\n1.00-4.00 credits.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n96291\n \n ","Department Code":"MEDST","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2016/SPRING/MEDST/295/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(28, 14, 67)","size":10.0},{"label":"MEDST-300MC","x":2.0,"y":0.0,"id":"2","attributes":{"Title":"Muslim/Christian Encounters","Description":"Spring\n2015\nMedieval Studies\n300MC\nMount Holyoke College\nThis course explores a set of recently discovered documents that substantially changes our understanding of Christian/Muslim relations.

From a variety of perspectives, authors try to account for what love is, what its effects are on the body and the soul, how one is supposed to obtain it and keep it, and also how and why it can be avoided. Writing about love is also questioning what is considered essentially good or bad for oneself and the community. In this course, students will explore medieval and early modern love theories and practices in a selection of Spanish texts, as they reflect on literature as a means for ethical interrogation.\nPrereq: Spanish 212.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n91665,91651\n91665\n \n ","Department Code":"MEDST","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/MHC/2015/SPRING/MEDST/217BL/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(28, 14, 67)","size":10.0},{"label":"MEDST-212","x":3.0,"y":0.0,"id":"4","attributes":{"Title":"MEDST-212","Description":"not offered in the last 4 semesters","Department Code":"MEDST","Course Site":"","Requisite":""},"color":"rgb(28, 14, 67)","size":10.0}]}
