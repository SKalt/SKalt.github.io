Weimar Cinema 'realized' the cultural-critical and economic dimensions of Romantic texts by filming the margins: Dracula, shadows, fairytales. Even Nazi-supporter Riefenstahl drew on the dark side of the tradition. All postwar Germanys have struggled to find common languages for a globalized economy and a de-facto immigrant society. Presently culture wars are raging again about gender-inclusive language and the Judeo-Christian tradition versus Islam.\nThis course is limited to seniors.\nThis seminar may constitute the first 4 credits of the 8 credits of independent work required for completion of an honors thesis.

We analyze the global contexts in which the films came into being and the changing reception of the films with the advent of digital distribution. With a focus on less well-known films from newly distributed archival footage and more recent documentaries made by second- and third-generation children of survivors and perpetrators, we examine issues such as the precarious relationship between memory and history and the ethics of filming the dead and individuals in pain.\nCourse limited to sophomores, juniors and seniors\nTaught in English.
