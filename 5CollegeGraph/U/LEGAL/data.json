As a political strategy to manage the social friction between minorities and majorities in increasingly diverse nation-states, multiculturalism has come under attack from both the right and left poles of the political spectrum throughout the world for its ostensible failures. Muslims have occupied a central place in these local, national and international debates. The threat of Islamic terrorism has provoked a measurable rise among European and North American nationals of what scholars and activists have somewhat controversially named \"Islamophobia\". This course surveys scholarship about this vexed role of Muslim minorities in what is conventionally called \"the West\", paying special attention to how the domain of law has become the defining terrain in which these debates play out and are contested. Drawing on anthropology, sociology, history and legal studies scholarship, we will explore such topics as: the links between anti-Muslim attitudes and racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia; legacies of colonialism and the impacts of transnational migration; the history of multicultural policies; contemporary gender and sexual politics; secularism, blasphemy and the limits of free speech; the interpenetration of immigration and criminal justice; profiling and terrorism.\nLegal Studies Majors only.

While no prior experience in interpreting is necessary, students must have a strong command of English and an emerging proficiency in at least one other language. The course will introduce students to current research in interpreting studies and to a number of basic practical skills required of professional interpreters. Interpreting will be viewed throughout the course as a socio-cultural activity as well as a linguistic one. The social, cultural and ethical complexities of the interpreter?s role will therefore be an important focus of the course. In Part I of the course, students will work with written texts to develop an understanding of micro-textual elements and macro-textual structures and patterns. Students will practice how to understand, analyze, process and reformulate written texts through text analysis and note-taking strategies. They will also begin to develop their listening skills with memory and concentration improvement exercises applied to short spoken texts. The importance for interpreters to develop both general knowledge and specific knowledge about the field in which an interpreting activity takes place will be emphasized. The primary mode of practice in Part I will be consecutive interpreting in health care and legal contexts. Role plays in these two areas will be conducted to familiarize students with the triadic nature of interpreted communication.\nTwo 300-level courses in a foreign language or a period of study abroad as a pre-requisite.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n70661\n \n ","Department Code":"COMP","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2014/FALL/COMP-LIT/481/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":["Two 300-level courses in a foreign language or a period of study abroad as a pre-requisite."]},"color":"rgb(198, 153, 61)","size":10.0},{"label":"LEGAL-596","x":43.0,"y":0.0,"id":"18","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study","Description":"Spring\n2016\nLegal Studies\n596\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n61061\n \n ","Department Code":"LEGAL","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/LEGAL/596/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(23, 168, 126)","size":10.0},{"label":"LEGAL-396ISH","x":44.0,"y":0.0,"id":"19","attributes":{"Title":"Hnr Indstu In Legal","Description":"Spring\n2016\nLegal Studies\n396ISH\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nStudents must apply through CHC PATHS to add this course\nVaries from 3 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n61066\n \n ","Department Code":"LEGAL","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/LEGAL/396ISH/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(23, 168, 126)","size":10.0},{"label":"LEGAL-H497I","x":45.0,"y":0.0,"id":"20","attributes":{"Title":"Honors Colloquium LEGAL 497I","Description":"Fall\n2014\nLegal Studies\nH497I\nUMass Amherst\nDescription not available at this time\nsimultaneously enrolled in 497i or by Instructor Consent\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n70986\n \n ","Department Code":"LEGAL","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2014/FALL/LEGAL/H497I/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(23, 168, 126)","size":10.0},{"label":"LEGAL-394CI","x":11.0,"y":1.0,"id":"21","attributes":{"Title":"Law, Crime and Society","Description":"Spring\n2016\nLegal Studies\n394CI\nUMass Amherst\nThis course explores the interplay between law, crimes, and social institutions like the family, the state, and political economy.

This course focuses on one of these areas in particular: the tension between the rights of individual and the rights of the group. We will examine this set of contradictions within liberal democratic thought by studying labor unions, which occupy a unique position in our society. On the one hand, unions have often been accused of being communist front organizations (seeking to impose the ?good? of the group over that of any individual), while on the other hand they are also often accused of being houses of corruption and havens for organized crime (going above and around the law to benefit only themselves). Despite this twin set of accusations, unions are also given special rights and privileges under the law of the United States. In this course, we will examine the ways in which the legal, social, and theoretical history of labor unions can help us to understand the ways in which this tension between the individual and the group plays out in liberal democracy.\nPre Req: LEGAL 250\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n79370\n \n ","Department Code":"LEGAL","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2014/FALL/LEGAL/397CC/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(23, 168, 126)","size":10.0},{"label":"LEGAL-391GL","x":13.0,"y":1.0,"id":"24","attributes":{"Title":"S-Gender and the Law","Description":"Spring\n2015\nLegal Studies\n391GL\nUMass Amherst\nThis class explores the socially constructed norms and frameworks enabling the legal regulation of gender.

Human intuition is easily led astray when tasked with judging probabilistic and causal arguments at the heart of these and other such questions. It takes mental training to better avoid the pitfalls to careful reasoning under uncertainty. We consider different ways that philosophers, scientists, and statisticians have sought to interpret probability and causation, the practical techniques that have emerged, and how they may be applied to certain problems in public policy and law.
