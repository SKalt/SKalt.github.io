This course focuses on one of these areas in particular: the tension between the rights of individual and the rights of the group. We will examine this set of contradictions within liberal democratic thought by studying labor unions, which occupy a unique position in our society. On the one hand, unions have often been accused of being communist front organizations (seeking to impose the ?good? of the group over that of any individual), while on the other hand they are also often accused of being houses of corruption and havens for organized crime (going above and around the law to benefit only themselves). Despite this twin set of accusations, unions are also given special rights and privileges under the law of the United States. In this course, we will examine the ways in which the legal, social, and theoretical history of labor unions can help us to understand the ways in which this tension between the individual and the group plays out in liberal democracy.\nPre Req: LEGAL 250\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n79370\n \n ","Department Code":"LEGA","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2014/FALL/LEGAL/397CC/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(110, 182, 225)","size":10.0},{"label":[10,"LEGAL-298"],"x":5.0,"y":2.0,"id":"(10, 'LEGAL-298')","attributes":{"Title":"Practicum","Description":"Spring\n2016\nLegal Studies\n298\nUMass Amherst\nFieldwork experience for qualified students.

As a political strategy to manage the social friction between minorities and majorities in increasingly diverse nation-states, multiculturalism has come under attack from both the right and left poles of the political spectrum throughout the world for its ostensible failures. Muslims have occupied a central place in these local, national and international debates. The threat of Islamic terrorism has provoked a measurable rise among European and North American nationals of what scholars and activists have somewhat controversially named \"Islamophobia\". This course surveys scholarship about this vexed role of Muslim minorities in what is conventionally called \"the West\", paying special attention to how the domain of law has become the defining terrain in which these debates play out and are contested. Drawing on anthropology, sociology, history and legal studies scholarship, we will explore such topics as: the links between anti-Muslim attitudes and racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia; legacies of colonialism and the impacts of transnational migration; the history of multicultural policies; contemporary gender and sexual politics; secularism, blasphemy and the limits of free speech; the interpenetration of immigration and criminal justice; profiling and terrorism.\nLegal Studies Majors only.

Are publicly funded programs helping the intended beneficiaries? Should a new technology be considered a health risk? How can one manage to sensibly synthesize multiple strands of evidence of criminal wrongdoing, discrimination, or liability to reach a sound judgment? Human intuition is easily led astray when tasked with judging probabilistic and causal arguments at the heart of these and other such questions. It takes mental training to better avoid the pitfalls to careful reasoning under uncertainty. We consider different ways that philosophers, scientists, and statisticians have sought to interpret probability and causation, the practical techniques that have emerged, and how they may be applied to certain problems in public policy and law. Grappling with a number of interesting fallacies, puzzles, and paradoxes along the way, students will deepen their ability to critically examine competing claims about data, analyze and interpret evidence, and identify areas of genuine ambiguity.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n70211\n70210\n \n ","Department Code":"LEGA","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/LEGAL/297V/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(110, 182, 225)","size":10.0},{"label":[69,"LEGAL-291C"],"x":73.0,"y":1.0,"id":"(69, 'LEGAL-291C')","attributes":{"Title":"S-CurrentLitigation/SocIssues","Description":"Spring\n2016\nLegal Studies\n291C\nUMass Amherst\nThe capital \"L\" Law is the most conspicuous tool that government uses to exert control over the behavior of people and institutions.
