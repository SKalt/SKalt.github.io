This course provides the opportunity for incoming graduate students to interact regularly with other graduate students and faculty to maintain a sense of community within the Program. Students will learn about available opportunities for extramural funding, the basics of grant-writing, and learn to become active participants in discussions of research in \ncolloquia. Resources that are available on-campus and on-line for research related activities will be highlighted. At the end of the semester each student will prepare and present an academic talk regarding their research or research interests. A series of short seminars will be given by faculty within the Neuroscience and Behavior Program to allow students to become familiar with current research in each of the core areas of the program: Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience; Neural and Behavioral Development; Neuroendocrinology; Animal Behavior, Learning and Computational Neuroscience; and, Sensory and Motor Systems.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n34664\n \n ","Department Code":"NEUROS&B","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/NEUROS%26B/792A/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(38, 3, 183)","size":10.0},{"label":"PSYCH-618","x":1.0,"y":1.0,"id":"3","attributes":{"Title":"Behavioral & Cognitive Neurosc","Description":"Spring\n2016\nPsychology & Brain Sciences\n618\nUMass Amherst\nAn overview of systems neuroscience, with special emphasis on cognition, including perception, recognition, attention, and motor control.
