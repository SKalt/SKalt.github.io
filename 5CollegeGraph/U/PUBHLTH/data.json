We will also address the ethics of public health emergencies; ethical questions in public health genetics; and public health concerns with social justice.

How does exposure to air pollutants manifest in chronic disease? What level of exposure is too much and how can I minimize my exposure? The goal of this course is to answer these questions and provide you with tools to quantify the environmental risks of air pollution.\nExposure to air pollution is unavoidable and ranks as one of the top ten global health risks in the development of non-communicable diseases. Air pollution represents a complex mixture of thousands of gaseous and particulate chemicals. Case studies will be used to illustrate the environmental health concerns surrounding major air pollution emission sources, including vehicle emissions, activities in our homes and from energy generation. We will explore methods to measure exposure to air pollutants, trace the fate of these pollutants in the body and discuss the biological mechanisms which underpin the onset of pollutant-induced respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Through readings and discussions, this course will explore why certain populations are more vulnerable to air pollution as well as contrast pollutant exposure and disease risk across developed and developing nations.\nThis course is open to Commonwealth Honors College students only.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n70153\n \n ","Department Code":"PUBHLTH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/PUBHLTH/397BH/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(149, 132, 178)","size":10.0},{"label":"PUBHLTH-129","x":110.0,"y":0.0,"id":"103","attributes":{"Title":"Health Care For All","Description":"Spring\n2016\nPublic Health\n129\nUMass Amherst\nU.S. health care system with emphasis on issues relating to unequal access to health services.
