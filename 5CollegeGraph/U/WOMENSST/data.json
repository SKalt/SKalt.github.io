African Diaspora. From parent-child affections, to heterosexual romance, to queer intimacies, to the closeness between friends, \"love\" is a central theme in literature and a crucial part of how we define humanity. Focusing on twentieth and twenty-first century texts such as Junot Diaz's This is How you Lose Her, Mariama Ba's So Long a Letter, Ben Okri's The Famished Road, Dee Rees's Pariah, and Toni Morrison's Love, we will consider how various forms of intimacy are written and read in the African Diaspora.  We will take up these works alongside key texts from earlier moments in Afrodiasporic literature, as well as theoretical and critical work in Diaspora feminism, queer theory, and affect studies. Reading through these lenses, we will consider several questions: How do processes of Diaspora, including enslavement, colonization, migration, and war shape how love is imagined in Afrodiasporic literature? What do literary affective relationships reveal about cultural notions of gender, sexuality, class, ethnicity, and race? How are intimacy and human connection evoked through various Diasporic modernist, magical realist, and other literary techniques? How are notions of love and intimacy used to invoke transnational connection in Diasporic spoken word and hip-hop?\nCourse requirements include two short papers, a final paper, and a short presentation.

Issues such as contraceptives, abortion, gay marriage, transgender rights, sexual education and assisted reproductive technology have risen to the top of some countries' agendas after decades of silence, taboos, and restrictive or non-existent legislation. The course aims to provide a survey of sexual and reproductive rights in Latin America comparing the region as a whole with other areas of the world, while at the same time highlighting the disparities that exist within it. The course analyzes the multiple factors behind the current policies focusing particularly on the role of women and gay rights movements in advancing more liberal legislation. In addition, we will look at the role of the Catholic Church in these debates and their struggles to prevent any legislative change that goes against their doctrine from happening.

The topics we will focus on to bring out these connections include love as a value and a social construction, violence (both personal and institutional), and material class power as it reinforces and undermines racism, sexism, heterosexism, and trans oppression. We will also consider feminist visions and theories of justice. Although the course will be organized topically there will be some attention to historical writings of feminist theory. The theories of race, gender, sexuality and social domination of Marx, Freud and Foucault will be considered through those feminist theorists who have appropriated aspects of their theories and methods. Attention will be given to women of color feminism and queer theory.

Wade, the 1960s and 1970s witnessed a \"sexual revolution\" in the United States and indeed in much of the world.  Among other things, the sexual revolution was marked by new forms of sexual expression and practices and new visions for sexual relations, ethics, and sexual-social organization.   Central to the sexual revolution was the concept of sexual liberation, the idea that repressed sexual subjects, desires, and practices were now freed of their previous constraints.  This claim was seen as particularly true for women and for gay men and lesbians.  But what did sexual liberation really mean for these actors?  Did it mean the same thing to all?  How did women differ in their understanding and experience of sexual liberation?  Was liberation synonymous with pleasure?  With emotional fulfillment?  With independence?  Was sexual liberation even financially tenable for women?  And what did a politics of sexual liberation look like for different actors?  This course will explore the complexity of sexual liberation by examining the history of the sexual revolution in the US from the 1960s and the 1980s, focusing on feminist and gay liberation thought and cultural products from the period.

In exploring these questions, this course examines Asian American histories, bodies, identities, diasporic communities, representations, and politics through multi- and interdisciplinary approaches, including social science research, literature, popular representations, film, poetry and art.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n70016\n \n ","Department Code":"WOMENSST","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/WOMENSST/392AA/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(68, 201, 223)","size":10.0},{"label":"WOMENSST-692C","x":38.0,"y":0.0,"id":"33","attributes":{"Title":"S-Issues in Feminist Theory","Description":"Spring\n2015\nWomen, Gender, Sexuality\n692C\nUMass Amherst\nThis seminar is designed for graduate students who want to improve their background in feminist theory as it has developed in the 20th and 21st century United States.

There are countries such as Chile, El Salvador and Nicaragua in which abortion is criminalized even in cases in which the mother's life is at risk. This course introduces students to the politics of abortion in the Americas. Some of the questions we will consider are: what role have women's movements played in advancing abortion rights in the region? What has mattered most for the movements' success, their internal characteristics or external forces? Has the way the movement framed the demand for the right to abortion mattered? Has the increase in the number of women in positions of power made a difference? What about the coming to power of leftist governments in many Latin American countries?

On the one hand, this course provides students with grounding in the critical theories and histories informing the emergence of the field in the 1990s. What came before queer theory? What are the meanings of the word \"queer\"? How is \"queer studies\" different from feminist studies or lesbian and gay studies? What can \"queer\" as a theory and a method offer our studies of bodies, desires, and practices? Is there a connection between queer theory and queer politics? On the other hand, this course invites students to engage with some of the most recent interventions into the field. How have scholars brought \"queer\" into conversation with postcolonial studies, critical race theory, disability studies, and Native American Studies? What are the limits and possibilities of these projects? In what ways have the recent trends within queer studies made possible critical interventions beyond the realm of sex and sexuality? How does queer theory open new ways of imagining and inhabiting the world?

Police violence against black people and the interrelated criminalization of black communities have a long history, older than the US itself. There is a similarly long and important history of activism and social movements against police violence and criminalization. Today, black people are disproportionately subject to police surveillance and violence, arrest, and incarceration.

Sparked by the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in Stanford, Florida, and Zimmerman?s acquittal as well as the police killings of other black men and women, including Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, and Freddie Gray, this movement challenges police violence and other policing that makes black communities unsafe as well as social constructions of black people as inherently dangerous and criminal. Police violence against black people and the interrelated criminalization of black communities have a long history, older than the US itself. There is a similarly long and important history of activism and social movements against police violence and criminalization. Today, black people are disproportionately subject to police surveillance and violence, arrest, and incarceration. So, too, are other people of color (both men and women) and queer, trans, and gender nonconforming people of all races but especially those of color. This course will examine the history of policing and criminalization of black, queer, and trans people and communities and related anti-racist, feminist, and queer/trans activism. In doing so, we will interrogate how policing and understandings of criminality - or the view that certain people or groups are inherently dangerous or criminal - in the US have long been deeply shaped by race, gender, and sexuality.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n40754\n40684\n \n ","Department Code":"WOMENSST","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/WOMENSST/295P/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(68, 201, 223)","size":10.0},{"label":"WOMENSST-296ISH","x":89.0,"y":0.0,"id":"92","attributes":{"Title":"Hnr Indstu In Wost","Description":"Spring\n2016\nWomen, Gender, Sexuality\n296ISH\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nStudents must apply through CHC PATHS to add this course   To add this course, find a faculty sponsor with whom to plan your work.
