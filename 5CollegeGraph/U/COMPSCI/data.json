On the other hand, many computer systems don't perform nearly as well as Google - hence the now-cliche \"the system is down.\" In this class, we study the scientific principles behind the construction of high-performance, scalable systems. The course begins with a discussion of the relevant features of modern architectures, and moves up the stack from there to operating system services such as programming language runtime systems, concurrency and synchronization, with a focus on key operating system features, I/O and networking, and distributed services.\nOpen to Computer Science majors only.

Participants study artificial intelligence in education, a young field that explores theories about learning, and explores how to build software that delivers differential teaching as it adapt its response to student needs and domain knowledge. Such software supports people who work alone or in collaborative inquiry, students who question their own knowledge, and students who rapidly access and integrate global information. This course describes how to build these tutors and how to produce the best possible learning environment, whether for classroom instruction or lifelong learning.  The objective of the course is to stimulate awareness of research issues and to promote sound analytic and design skills as they pertain to building knowledge representations and control strategies. Specific topics include collaboration, inquiry, dialogue systems, machine learning, simulators, authoring tools and user models.  The course is appropriate for students from many disciplines (computer science, linguistics, education, and psychology), researchers, and practitioners from academia, industry, and government. No programming is required. Students read and critique tools, methods, and ideas, learn how artificial intelligence is applied (e.g., vision, natural language), and study the complexity of human learning through advances in cognitive science.\nOpen to Graduate students only.   4 SEATS ARE RESERVED FOR MA EDUC MAJORS.

Access to an abundance of open source languages, libraries, and frameworks has led to the quick and easy construction of a variety of applications with several moving parts working in coordination to present to the user the illusion of a single program. In reality, web applications and services are extremely difficult to get right. They involve complicated user interfaces, multiple databases, security holes and performance issues, and a multitude of ever changing remote services, spread across several physical and virtual machines. These complications are further stressed by the large number of concurrent users that access these applications every second.  This complexity leads to failed applications, performance bottlenecks, and security breaches. This course focuses on all areas of building scalable web systems. Topics include the study of cyber security, big data, system design, best practices, redundancy, scalability, performance and monitoring, and key principles in the agile development of complicated distributed web applications.

Access to an abundance of open source languages, libraries, and frameworks has led to the quick and easy construction of a variety of applications with several moving parts working in coordination to present to the user the illusion of a single program. In reality, web applications and services are extremely difficult to get right. They involve complicated user interfaces, multiple databases, security holes and performance issues, and a multitude of ever changing remote services, spread across several physical and virtual machines. These complications are further stressed by the large number of concurrent users that access these applications every second.  This complexity leads to failed applications, performance bottlenecks, and security breaches. This course focuses on all areas of building scalable web systems. Topics include the study of cyber security, big data, system design, best practices, redundancy, scalability, performance and monitoring, and key principles in the agile development of complicated distributed web applications. Students will work as a team to design, develop, monitor, and analyze a large and scalable web application.
