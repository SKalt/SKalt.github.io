The course reinforces principles of the engineering design process and serves as a capstone for electrical and computer engineering knowledge obtained in the ECE curriculum. The consideration of the ethical and social implications of technology and the basic concepts of business are also aspects of the course. Each student design team is expected to present information related to their project in both written and oral formats.

Our human body is comprised of a multitude of systems that operate without our conscious intervention and there are many man-made systems that operate based on man-made principles and rules. In this course students gain a fundamental understanding of the structure of some such systems, learn how to analyze their operation, explore methods for controlling them and become aware of the importance of feedback. This is accomplished through an engineering science approach where art and science are used to apply scientific knowledge for the solution of practical problems. Physical laws are used to develop system models; system structures and characteristics are identified; mathematical methods are introduced to study system behavior; system stability and performance are examined; feedback controllers are designed to achieve desired performance; digital computer simulations are employed to enhance the learning experience. By taking the course students gain a greater understanding of the role systems and control has played in our world in the past and will increasing do so in the future. They are exposed to the engineering science way of thinking for the solution to practical problems. They gain a deeper appreciation of how a multitude of diverse systems all around us share a basic underlying structure and have the same or very similar dynamic characteristics. They learn about universal methods for systems analysis and controller design and are sensitized about limitations. The knowledge acquired will increase their awareness of the world around them and can have impact on their daily lives.\nOpen to Commonwealth Honors College Students only.
