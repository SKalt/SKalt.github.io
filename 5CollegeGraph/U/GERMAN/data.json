A wide range of figures grappled with the central issues of the age:  war, violence and the Holocaust; industrialization, urbanization and the fragmentation of modern identity.  Yet innovations in style and critical engagement with European traditions have produced works of profound beauty and world influence.  A range of short prose will be treated, with student writing focused on analysis of style in relation to cultural debates of the century.  Texts from such authors as Freud, Mann, Kafka, Brecht, Benjamin, Tucholsky, Seghers, Wolf, Grass, Biermann and more contemporary figures representing the increasing diversity of culture in Germany since reunification.

The main areas covered are:  European pagan religions and the spread of Christianity; the \"Burning Times\" in early modern Europe, with an emphasis on the German situation; 17th-century New England and the Salem witch trials; the images of witches in folk lore and fairy tales in the context of the historical persecutions; and contemporary Wiccan/witch practices in their historical context.  The goal of the course is to deconstruct the stereotypes that many of us have about witches/witchcraft, especially concerning sexuality, gender, age, physical appearance, occult powers, and Satanism.  Readings are drawn from documentary records of the witch persecutions and witch trials, literary representations, scholarly analyses of witch-related phenomena, and essays examining witches, witchcraft, and the witch persecutions from a contemporary feminist or neo-pagan perspective.  The lectures will be supplemented by related material taken from current events in addition to visual material (videos, slides) drawn from art history, early modern witch literature, popular culture, and documentary sources.
