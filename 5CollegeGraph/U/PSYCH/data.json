Interest focuses on the shape of mean growth, the variability in individual growth curves around the mean growth curve, and person-level characteristics that predict differences in growth curves.\nThe course will consider the formulation of statistical models for these applications. Topics include an introduction to the basic two-level model for continuous outcomes, assessment of fit, checking model assumptions, single and multiparameter hypothesis testing, and the extension to three-level models. Special topics include univariate and multivariate models for dyads.\nParticipants will be exposed to a wide variety of examples, with emphasis on the interpretation and reporting of results.

For the purpose of this course, we will use a broad definition of social groups, although particular attention will be focused on race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and age. The first part of this course will examine how people's own group membership and the culture in which they live influence their attitudes and behavior toward others who belong to the same group (\"ingroup\") or to different groups (\"outgroups\").  The second part of this course will focus on evaluating interventions that may help alleviate interindividual and intergroup conflicts that arise during social interactions among people of differing cultural backgrounds. The final part of this course will focus on the different ways in which cultural stereotypes affect members of disadvantaged groups (e.g., in terms of mental health, physical health, performance, achievement, self-esteem etc.). In this section of the course, we will also pay attention to the different ways in which individuals from various disadvantaged groups protect themselves and show psychological resilience.\nOpen to Graduate Psychology majors only.

It offers students the opportunity to actually provide direct services, under supervision, in two clinical settings.  In the first, after receiving training to become a Certified Decisional Trainer, students meet for weekly individual sessions to conduct a manualized Cognitive Behavior Therapy problem-solving treatment with a person currently incarcerated in the Hampshire County Jail and House of Corrections, a Northampton facility which has been recognized as one of the most progressive correctional facilities in the nation.  In the second, students interested in gaining more clinical experience with adults assist staff in one of the acute psychiatric wards at the VAMC in Leeds (which was the first VA facility in the nation established to work exclusively with psychiatric patients), while students interested in gaining more clinical experience with children assist staff working with children in need of anger-management skills at the People's Institute Day Care and After School Programs in Northampton.  Because this course is designed to be a Laboratory in Clinical Psychology and not a laboratory in Psychotherapy, all students enrolled in the course must be concurrently enrolled for at least three academic credits in a research activity.  That activity may involve working as a Research Assistant for a faculty member or graduate student, conducting Honors Thesis or Capstone Research, or being enrolled in a graded Independent Study that involves research work.

The psychology department of UMass has long offered courses in both these areas, and the course I'm proposing aims at providing a bridge course, which focuses on the relationship between the design of an empirical study (correlational, quasi-experimental, experimental, etc.), and the data analytical techniques that can be used to extract valuable information from the data so collected. Rather than teaching this process in piecemeal fashion, as is commonly done (and necessary) in statistics or research methods, this course will take a holistic approach, focusing on how to use all available techniques at hand in order to fully analyze any given data set from start to finish. In the course we start from students' research questions and their own datasets, and we discuss the appropriate course of action in terms of data preparation (e.g. checking for distributions and data transformation, identifying univariate and multivariate outliers, etc.) and the specific statistical techniques to be used afterwards to test hypotheses, to use different analyses in a consistent manner within a study and across multiple studies belong to the same future publication. We will use students' own data to conduct the analyses, so that students have the added benefit of having an in-depth analysis of their research data. Analyses will be done with the aid of SAS, which is a powerful and flexible statistical package. Therefore the first few seminars will be devoted to learn its jargon. I have taught this program before to graduate students at The New School for Social Research, and I can attest that students will learn basic skills in SAS very quickly, and be ready to move on to the answering substantive questions using sophisticated analytical techniques.\nOpen to Graduate students only.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n17947\n \n ","Department Code":"PSYCH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/SPRING/PSYCH/891DA/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(147, 187, 161)","size":10.0},{"label":"PSYCH-499P","x":125.0,"y":0.0,"id":"130","attributes":{"Title":"Honors Project","Description":"Spring\n2016\nPsychology & Brain Sciences\n499P\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nContact COMCOL\nVaries from 3 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n64845\n \n ","Department Code":"PSYCH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/PSYCH/499P/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(147, 187, 161)","size":10.0},{"label":"PSYCH-499Y","x":126.0,"y":0.0,"id":"131","attributes":{"Title":"Honors Research","Description":"Spring\n2016\nPsychology & Brain Sciences\n499Y\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nContact COMCOL\nVaries from 3 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n64847\n \n ","Department Code":"PSYCH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/PSYCH/499Y/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(147, 187, 161)","size":10.0},{"label":"PSYCH-491F","x":45.0,"y":3.0,"id":"132","attributes":{"Title":"S-Dvlpmntl Challenges We Face","Description":"Spring\n2016\nPsychology & Brain Sciences\n491F\nUMass Amherst\nIn this seminar, students will be presented with case studies that highlight challenges facing children and young adults in our society.

The course centers on six case studies of knowledge development. The case studies draw on evidence from several disciplines including comparative psychology, behavioral ecology, cultural anthropology, linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, and history of science, but the main focus will be on experimental data from cognitive and developmental psychology. Questions include: How does human biology constrain and support human mental life? How variable is human knowledge across different cultures? What aspects of human knowledge are unique to our species and what aspects are shared by other animals? How does knowledge change as children grow and as adults gain expertise?\nSenior Psychology Majors only.
