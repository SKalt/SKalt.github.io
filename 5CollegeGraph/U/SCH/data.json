In the post-genome era, plant pathologists have a new generation of tools that are ripe with the potential to influence how we manage plant diseases. During this journal club we will focus on research papers and case studies that illustrate how new technologies can be used to build our knowledge base and how new findings can influence disease management. Examples of potential topics for discussion include molecular epidemiology of plant pathogens, rapid molecular diagnostic assays to detect disease, applying genomics technologies to better understand plant host and fungal pathogen interactions, and the evolution of fungicide resistance.\nOpen to Graduate students only.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n65073\n \n ","Department Code":"STOCKSCH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/STOCKSCH/692A/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(98, 42, 230)","size":10.0},{"label":"STOCKSCH-697AZ","x":268.5,"y":1.0,"id":"119","attributes":{"Title":"ST-Applied Zoology & Ev Bio","Description":"Spring\n2016\nStockbridge Sch of Agriculture\n697AZ\nUMass Amherst\nThis course provides an overview of animal diversity, evolution, behavior, morphology, and physiology.
