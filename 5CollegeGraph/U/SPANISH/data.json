The course includes a service-learning component such that students will work as tutors with Spanish-English bilinguals in Holyoke. We will examine the rise of Spanish-speaking communities across the US and will ask crucial questions such as: In what ways can varieties of US Spanish be deemed unacceptable? What Spanish varieties in Spain and Latin America, if any, can be considered linguistically pure or unmixed? What are the implications and repercussions of disallowing heritage languages in elementary schools? In what ways can bilingualism be an advantage or disadvantage? How does the bilingual situation in Holyoke compare to other bilingual situations in the U.S.? Throughout the course students will work together to create tutoring guidelines and best practices that can be made available to future tutors in the area.\nAll readings in this course are in ENGLISH and there is no Spanish language requirement for this course.\nAny of the following courses are recommended prior to taking this course, but not required: LING201, LING402, SPAN378 or SPAN470.

Also, due to some literary works put in evidence different modes of representation of reality, they allow us to deeply comprehend mad men and women as subjects of alterity, which, in turn, redefines rationality. Analyzing madness through both a close and a comparative readings of the literatures produced in Brazil, Argentina, and Spain students will grasp how each literature has represented mental illness as a means for the comprehension of the human condition. By the end of the course, students will be able to conceptualize and identify specific paradigms of madness in Spanish and Latin American short stories, and how the predominance of mental illness in them reinstates other dimensions of reality meant to occupy a space where they originally not expected.
