Applying to graduate school is highly competitive, particularly for clinical fields such as Physical Therapy, Physician Assistant, and Medical School. Many Kinesiology students intend to apply to one of those programs for the year after they graduate. By the time students are seniors, many have not been accepted to the program they were hoping to attend, or they are lacking the GPA or extracurricular activities to even apply. At this point, many students are not sure what the next step. This 1-credit seminar is focused on senior Kinesiology students who are trying to figure out that next step, as well as students who are still unsure of what they will be doing after graduation. With a degree in Kinesiology, students often feel overwhelmed with all the options they have to choose from. We will discuss topics such as: how to improve your resume after graduating college (jobs, experiences, professional development), how to figure out if graduate school is the best choice for you (type and location of program, cost, graduate assistantships), and how to search/apply/interview for jobs in the field of Kinesiology. I also plan to use realistic case studies involving real-life scenarios and assess them as a class from multiple perspectives (e.g. from a CPT, PA, PT, MD, etc.). The goal of this seminar is to help give students guidance at an overwhelming time in their academic career and help them succeed on their immediate next steps after graduation.\nClass is open to Seniors in Public Health, Kinesiology and Communication Disorders\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n70349\n \n ","Department Code":"KIN","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/KIN/497B/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(63, 216, 41)","size":10.0},{"label":"KIN-397L","x":78.0,"y":0.0,"id":"33","attributes":{"Title":"ST-Princ&Prac/SkelMuscleExprmt","Description":"Spring\n2016\nKinesiology\n397L\nUMass Amherst\nThe course is designed to provide students with theoretical and practical knowledge of current techniques in skeletal muscle experimentation, including at the whole muscle, tissue, cellular and molecular levels.
