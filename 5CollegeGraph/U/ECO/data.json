The rapid expansion of the Internet in the 1990's followed by the proliferation of smartphones and tablets in the early 21st century have put people across the globe in front of screens not just capable of text and photos, but video media as well.  Science and nature are facets of our world that lend themselves well to this \"video media revolution.\"  Video media can transform the complexities of science and nature into something more tangible and tractable.  As a greater awareness of sustainability becomes global, how can the \"video media revolution\" be used to deliver an authentic and accurate message that is both educational and entertaining?  Can video media in a diversity of forms be used to positively affect change in they way human societies respond to scientific discoveries and environmental urgencies?  In this discussion-based course, we will examine how video media can be effectively used to enhance communication in science and conservation, ranging from fundraising to affecting public policy.\nOpen to Graduate students only.

This course will examine the emerging complexity of biotic interactions in the city, focusing on dynamics at the levels of populations, species and, communities.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n64334\n \n ","Department Code":"ECO","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/ECO/697UW/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(179, 252, 77)","size":10.0},{"label":"ECO-632","x":19.0,"y":0.0,"id":"20","attributes":{"Title":"ApplMultivartStats/EnvirConsrv","Description":"Spring\n2015\nEnvironmental Conservation\n632\nUMass Amherst\nThis course provides students with a conceptual and practical understanding of the application of multivariate statistics in ecology and conservation science.
