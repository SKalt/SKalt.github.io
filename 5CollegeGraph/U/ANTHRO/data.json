This class focuses on inequalities and health from a critical biocultural perspective, a perspective that includes structural violence, political ecology, eco-social, and other approaches that incorporate political economy, history, environment and biology into studies of human health.  We begin with discussion on the development of a critical biocultural perspective and perspectives on poverty and inequality.  The course will then use a series of case studies to explore how social inequalities along axes of race, class and gender shape biology and health and how health, in turn, contributes to poverty and inequality. We will explore how this takes place across the life-course and even generations. Topics for case studies may include: social and health impacts of income inequalities; psychosocial stress and related health issues; race, racism and health; political economy of epidemiological and nutritional transition; environmental disasters, degradation and environmental justice; armed conflicts and population displacement; violence, trauma and health; resilience and hope.  Students will be provided the opportunity to suggest readings related to their own sub-discipline and research interests, and so there is some flexibility in choosing the final list of case studies.\nThis course is open to Graduate Students in Anthropology only   Open to Anthropology Majors only.

Students will learn how to utilize library resources for research, how to access tutors and other forms of academic support, as well as general tips on how to make their time at UMASS as successful and productive as possible.\nThe second goal is to introduce students to anthropology, particularly the subfields of biological anthropology and archaeology. To do this, we will explore key concepts in anthropology as revealed by the skeleton. The skeleton is a remarkably dynamic organic system that changes throughout our lives, and therefore contains many clues about who we are. We will see how researchers use the clues \"locked in bone\" to learn things about behavior, health, migration, conflict, and cultural practices in past populations. From fossil hominins to Egyptian pharaohs to ourselves, we will investigate the many ways that anthropologists engage with skeletal remains to discover the richness of life, past and present.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n40699\n \n ","Department Code":"ANTHRO","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/ANTHRO/191ANTH1/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(129, 21, 106)","size":10.0},{"label":"ANTHRO-698","x":54.0,"y":0.0,"id":"42","attributes":{"Title":"Practicum","Description":"Spring\n2016\nAnthropology\n698\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nVaries from 1 to 12 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n63083\n \n ","Department Code":"ANTHRO","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/ANTHRO/698/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(129, 21, 106)","size":10.0},{"label":"ANTHRO-597CR","x":55.0,"y":0.0,"id":"43","attributes":{"Title":"ST-Critical Race Theory","Description":"Spring\n2016\nAnthropology\n597CR\nUMass Amherst\nDescription not available at this time\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n63219\n \n ","Department Code":"ANTHRO","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/ANTHRO/597CR/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(129, 21, 106)","size":10.0},{"label":"SRVCLRNG-393TH","x":56.0,"y":1.0,"id":"44","attributes":{"Title":"Tools for Democratic Change","Description":"Spring\n2016\nService Learning\n393TH\nUMass Amherst\nThis is the second semester course in the Citizen Scholars Program.
