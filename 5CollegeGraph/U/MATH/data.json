From the mathematical perspective, geometric and analytical methods of describing the behavior of solutions will be developed and illustrated in the context of low-dimensional systems, including behavior near fixed points and periodic orbits, phase portraits, Lyapunov stability, Hamiltonian systems, bifurcation phenomena, and chaotic dynamics. From the applied perspective, numerous specific applications will be touched upon ranging from the laser to the synchronization of fireflies, and from the outbreaks of insects to chemical reactions or even prototypical models of love affairs. In addition to the theoretical component, a self-contained computational component towards addressing these systems will be developed with the assistance of MATLAB (and wherever relevant Mathematica).

Dispersive Partial Differential Equations (PDE) model certain wave propagation phenomena in nature. Dispersive waves are those that spread in space as time evolves while conserving energy (for example). Two of the most well known equations within this class are the nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the nonlinear wave equation. In this course we will focus on the semi-linear wave equation with power nonlinearity (NLW) and study in detail for it first the deterministic local and global well-posedness theory for the Cauchy initial value problem. This includes the classical results proved via energy estimates, improvements due to Strichartz estimates and culminating with the spectacular recent work by  Kenig and Merle establishing large data global well-posedness, scattering and blow up for the energy critical focusing nonlinear wave equations. Along the way we will point out and briefly discuss (albeit not prove) corresponding results and references for the nonlinear Schrodinger equations (NLS).  In the second part of the course we will study NLW from a non-deterministic point of view. To that effect, we introduce the concept of random Cauchy initial value problem, study the existence and invariance of associated Gibbs measures and almost sure well-posedeness (w.r.t. to the underlying probability measure).  Finally we will present results by Bourgain on the existence and invariance of Gibbs measures for certain one dimensional periodic NLS.  If time permits we will also describe the proof of a similar result for the periodic derivative NLS equation, a proof that will force us to introduce a certain gauge transformation and understand how the Gibbs measure transform under this gauge change.   \nPrerequisites: Knowledge of Real Analysis, basic Fourier analysis, basic probability theory and basic theory of partial differential equations including some knowledge of the theory of distributions (M623/M624/Stat605/M731 or equivalents)\nOpen to Graduate students only.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n69920\n \n ","Department Code":"MATH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/MATH/797DP/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":["Prerequisites: Knowledge of Real Analysis, basic Fourier analysis, basic probability theory and basic theory of partial differential equations including some knowledge of the theory of distributions (M623/M624/Stat605/M731 or equivalents)"]},"color":"rgb(211, 82, 8)","size":10.0},{"label":"MATH-891I","x":186.5,"y":0.0,"id":"151","attributes":{"Title":"Problem Seminar","Description":"Spring\n2016\nMathematics\n891I\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nOpen to Graduate students only.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n64487\n \n ","Department Code":"MATH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/MATH/891I/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(211, 82, 8)","size":10.0},{"label":"MATH-398","x":187.5,"y":0.0,"id":"152","attributes":{"Title":"Practicum","Description":"Spring\n2016\nMathematics\n398\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nVaries from 1 to 18 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n64467\n \n ","Department Code":"MATH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/MATH/398/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(211, 82, 8)","size":10.0},{"label":"MATH-391A","x":77.5,"y":0.0,"id":"153","attributes":{"Title":"Sem: Co-Seminar with MATH 300","Description":"Spring\n2016\nMathematics\n391A\nUMass Amherst\nContact department for description.\nStudents will register for an appropriate section shortly after Spring semester begins.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n64505\n \n ","Department Code":"MATH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/MATH/391A/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(211, 82, 8)","size":10.0},{"label":"MATH-498Y","x":188.5,"y":0.0,"id":"154","attributes":{"Title":"Practicum","Description":"Spring\n2016\nMathematics\n498Y\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nStudents must apply through CHC PATHS to add this course\nVaries from 1 to 18 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n64476\n \n ","Department Code":"MATH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/MATH/498Y/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(211, 82, 8)","size":10.0},{"label":"MATH-611","x":142.5,"y":1.0,"id":"155","attributes":{"Title":"Algebra I","Description":"Fall\n2015\nMathematics\n611\nUMass Amherst\nIntroduction to groups, rings, and fields.
