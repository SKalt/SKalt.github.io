The first, and most important, is to introduce Undergraduate Biology students to some of the many fascinating aspects of Plant Biology, especially as these differ from animal biology.  For instance, did you know that plants are moving (on a large scale) all the time?  It's the truth, but in a very different time scale than we animals use.  How do plants do that without the benefit of muscles and skeleton?  Have you ever thought about how, in the absence of a pumping heart, plants' circulatory systems work?  After all, the water at the top of a tree got there from roots in the ground, but no pump was involved.  Plants don't have an immune system, and yet, they 'stand and fight' - literally rooted to the spot - taking on all types of pathogens, as well insects and other predators.  What strategies do plants use to overcome these attacks?  Have you ever wondered about how biotechnology is used in agriculture?  We have all heard news stories about GMO's (genetically modified organisms).  What are these and what makes them useful or dangerous?  These are the types of topics we will be covering in this course.  The second goal for this course is to provide a convenient way for UMass Biology majors to accomplish their plant biology course requirement.\nPreReq:Bio100/151/190Hor101\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n33940\n \n ","Department Code":"BIOL","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2015/FALL/BIOLOGY/397D/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(30, 5, 68)","size":10.0},{"label":[77,"ANIMLSCI-390A"],"x":89.5,"y":1.0,"id":"(77, 'ANIMLSCI-390A')","attributes":{"Title":"Veterinary Microbiology","Description":"Spring\n2016\nAnimal Science\n390A\nUMass Amherst\nA team-oriented microbiology laboratory course for skill development and discovery, focusing on the importance of microbes in animal health and disease, and laboratory exercises designed to encourage students to develop and test hypotheses then think critically about their observations.\nThis course is open to BS-Animal Science & BS-Pre-Veterinary Science majors only.

Sometime the importance of the work is obvious at the time of publication and sometimes it takes many years for the true significance of the work to be appreciated. The Great Papers in Biology course is designed to allow students to read seminal papers in biology with the goals of: 1) understanding, in detail, how the experiments were\nconducted; 2) how the results were interpreted; and 3) how the work changed scientists' understanding of biology. Papers to be discussed will represent a wide range of fields within Biology, including: developmental biology, genetics/genomics, neuroscience, cell biology, and the mechanisms of disease.\nOpen to Senior and Junior Biology majors only.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n71024\n64016\n \n ","Department Code":"BIOL","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/BIOLOGY/597GP/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(30, 5, 68)","size":10.0},{"label":[122,"ENVIRSCI-390A"],"x":5.0,"y":3.0,"id":"(122, 'ENVIRSCI-390A')","attributes":{"Title":"Environmental Soil Science","Description":"Fall\n2015\nEnvironmental Science\n390A\nUMass Amherst\nIntroduction to physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil with emphasis on environmental science and natural resource applications.

Each part will also include inquiry-based learning where you will work in groups on a short research project to understand the cellular and molecular basis of a human genetic disease.  Each group will investigate 3 aspects of their assigned disease:  (1) the cell biology of the organelle or process that is disrupted, (2) the gene product that is defective, and (3) the experimental methods that scientists are using to understand, treat or cure the disease.
