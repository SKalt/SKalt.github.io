The first, and most important, is to introduce Undergraduate Biology students to some of the many fascinating aspects of Plant Biology, especially as these differ from animal biology.  For instance, did you know that plants are moving (on a large scale) all the time?  It's the truth, but in a very different time scale than we animals use.  How do plants do that without the benefit of muscles and skeleton?  Have you ever thought about how, in the absence of a pumping heart, plants' circulatory systems work?  After all, the water at the top of a tree got there from roots in the ground, but no pump was involved.  Plants don't have an immune system, and yet, they 'stand and fight' - literally rooted to the spot - taking on all types of pathogens, as well insects and other predators.  What strategies do plants use to overcome these attacks?  Have you ever wondered about how biotechnology is used in agriculture?  We have all heard news stories about GMO's (genetically modified organisms).  What are these and what makes them useful or dangerous?  These are the types of topics we will be covering in this course.  The second goal for this course is to provide a convenient way for UMass Biology majors to accomplish their plant biology course requirement.\nPreReq:Bio100/151/190Hor101\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n33940\n \n ","Department Code":"BIOLOGY","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/BIOLOGY/397D/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(65, 254, 199)","size":10.0},{"label":"BIOLOGY-196ISH","x":98.5,"y":0.0,"id":"31","attributes":{"Title":"Hnrs Indstu Biol","Description":"Spring\n2016\nBiology\n196ISH\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nStudents must apply through CHC PATHS to add this course\nVaries from 3 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n63891\n \n ","Department Code":"BIOLOGY","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/BIOLOGY/196ISH/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(65, 254, 199)","size":10.0},{"label":"BIOLOGY-496ISH","x":99.5,"y":0.0,"id":"32","attributes":{"Title":"Hnr Indstu In Biology","Description":"Spring\n2016\nBiology\n496ISH\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nStudents must apply through CHC PATHS to add this course\nVaries from 3 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n63894\n \n ","Department Code":"BIOLOGY","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/BIOLOGY/496ISH/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(65, 254, 199)","size":10.0},{"label":"BIOLOGY-192L","x":100.5,"y":0.0,"id":"33","attributes":{"Title":"Sem-Biotap","Description":"Spring\n2016\nBiology\n192L\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nOpen to students in the Biology TAP Sycamore program only.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n63896\n \n ","Department Code":"BIOLOGY","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/BIOLOGY/192L/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(65, 254, 199)","size":10.0},{"label":"BIOLOGY-597GPI","x":101.5,"y":0.0,"id":"34","attributes":{"Title":"ST-Great Papers/Bio (HnrsInd)","Description":"Spring\n2016\nBiology\n597GPISH\nUMass Amherst\nVaries from 4 to 5 credits\nMultiple required components--lab and/or discussion section.
