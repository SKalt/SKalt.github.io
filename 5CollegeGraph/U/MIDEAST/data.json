Through close readings of selected texts in this historical canon, we will examine the following questions and themes: how do Arab thinkers conceive of \"Arab\" identity? How do \"Arab\" identities relate to \"other\" identities? How has political freedom been defined by these authors? Do they imagine a uniquely \"Arab\" way to achieve such freedom? What are perceived as the legitimate bases of political authority in Arab society? Is revolution or reform the best way for establishing such authority?\nThe class will examine how central Arab thinkers formulate different responses to these questions. This examination will highlight some of the key ways in which Arab thinking about key political concepts (political freedom, justice, legitimacy, change) is similar to, and distinct from, the ways it has been conceived in western political theory.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n38766,41370\n39574\n \n ","Department Code":"MIDEAST","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/MIDEAST/392MA/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(254, 211, 53)","size":10.0},{"label":"MIDEAST-296H","x":4.0,"y":1.0,"id":"11","attributes":{"Title":"Hnrs Indstu MIDEAST","Description":"Spring\n2015\nMiddle Eastern Studies\n296H\nUMass Amherst\nContact the Bloom Honors Advising Center - 201 Commonwealth Honors College - to add this course\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n12416\n \n ","Department Code":"MIDEAST","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/SPRING/MIDEAST/296H/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(254, 211, 53)","size":10.0},{"label":"MIDEAST-190A","x":13.0,"y":1.0,"id":"12","attributes":{"Title":"WtrOil&Blood:MdEast/GlblPol","Description":"Spring\n2016\nMiddle Eastern Studies\n190A\nUMass Amherst\nThis course is a basic, interdisciplinary introduction to the contemporary Middle East, and uses three substances central to contemporary society as organizing metaphors for issues that help define the region that stretches from Morocco to Iran.
