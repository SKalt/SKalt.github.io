Most crucially, we will bring the diverse voices of our authors and the interdisciplinary perspectives you have acquired through your coursework to bear on the future of criminal justice: what can our past teach us about the best way forward?

Our primary task is to say what a poem means. But poetry can also be taught as a highly \"integrative\" art that is always engaged with \"real-world problems\" and to which we respond not just with interpretation, but with narration and explanation. Now our primary task becomes to explain what a poem does, or what we can do with a poem. This course builds on English majors' interpretive skills to lead them into these integrative powers of poetry. After students have discovered and explored them, they will be challenged to speak and write about poetry in ways that are also explanatory ? that enable their audience to understand and make use of poetry by integrating it with what they already think or know. We will also explore narrative as a powerful mode of explanation. Three main questions will shape our path into the integrative powers of poetry and lead us to discover that it deals with questions and issues that animate inquiry in many academic disciplines. Satisfies the Integrative Experience requirement for BA-Engl majors.\nThis class is open to Senior English majors only ENGLISH 200 w/ C or E200  This class is intended for English Primary Majors only.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n60810\n \n ","Department Code":"ENGLISH","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/ENGLISH/494WI/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(40, 187, 12)","size":10.0},{"label":"ENGLISH-254H","x":58.0,"y":0.0,"id":"49","attributes":{"Title":"Writ&Reading Imag Lit/Honors","Description":"Fall\n2015\nEnglish\n254H\nUMass Amherst\nStudents will examine problems of form, content, and development in fiction and poetry.

For example, what do dystopian narratives in comics, video games, and new media productions have in common? What makes \"dark,\" \"moody,\" and outright apocalyptic narratives like The Walking Dead, Half-Life 2, Left 4 Dead, Sweet Tooth and the web series Down Twisted popular in this current historical moment? Can postmodern cultural theory help us better understand some of the social and political ramifications of dystopian culture? Further, can the theory make more clear how such stories envision the perils of the future in ways that inadvertently comment on our current times? Is it possible that the cautionary tales of dystopian narratives might, if heeded, make the world a better place? We will compare different game genres in order to make arguments about the types of anxieties, fears, and dreams that get articulated in RPG games like Fallout 3, shooters like BioShock, war games like Metal Gear Solid 4, and in third person action games like Grand Theft Auto IV. Important note: This class will follow a team-based discussion format, meaning all students will be asked to play a leading role in class discussions and will be required to work closely on digital projects and select other assignments with members of a team. Access to an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 is not required but it is strongly preferred. Each team of five students will need at least one gaming console to share.
