Most crucially, we will bring the diverse voices of our authors and the interdisciplinary perspectives you have acquired through your coursework to bear on the future of criminal justice: what can our past teach us about the best way forward? Students will produce final projects in which they analyze some aspect of the US criminal justice system in terms of its history, its present, and its possible futures. In this way, our approach to our topic of study, prison writing, mirrors the goals of the Integrative Experience, which invites you to reflect on your academic journey to date and to draw on the skills and insights you?ve gained in order to envision your own future: what do you like to learn? How do you prefer to learn? What does your course of study tell you about your values, your strengths and weaknesses, the kinds of work you find rewarding? Because prison writing spans disciplinary and generic boundaries, it provides an ideal platform for comparative, interdisciplinary, and hybrid/experimental projects that speak to a range of audiences.

Our primary task is to say what a poem means. But poetry can also be taught as a highly \"integrative\" art that is always engaged with \"real-world problems\" and to which we respond not just with interpretation, but with narration and explanation. Now our primary task becomes to explain what a poem does, or what we can do with a poem. This course builds on English majors' interpretive skills to lead them into these integrative powers of poetry. After students have discovered and explored them, they will be challenged to speak and write about poetry in ways that are also explanatory ? that enable their audience to understand and make use of poetry by integrating it with what they already think or know. We will also explore narrative as a powerful mode of explanation. Three main questions will shape our path into the integrative powers of poetry and lead us to discover that it deals with questions and issues that animate inquiry in many academic disciplines.

For example, what do dystopian narratives in comics, video games, and new media productions have in common? What makes \"dark,\" \"moody,\" and outright apocalyptic narratives like The Walking Dead, Half-Life 2, Left 4 Dead, Sweet Tooth and the web series Down Twisted popular in this current historical moment? Can postmodern cultural theory help us better understand some of the social and political ramifications of dystopian culture? Further, can the theory make more clear how such stories envision the perils of the future in ways that inadvertently comment on our current times? Is it possible that the cautionary tales of dystopian narratives might, if heeded, make the world a better place? We will compare different game genres in order to make arguments about the types of anxieties, fears, and dreams that get articulated in RPG games like Fallout 3, shooters like BioShock, war games like Metal Gear Solid 4, and in third person action games like Grand Theft Auto IV. Important note: This class will follow a team-based discussion format, meaning all students will be asked to play a leading role in class discussions and will be required to work closely on digital projects and select other assignments with members of a team. Access to an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 is not required but it is strongly preferred. Each team of five students will need at least one gaming console to share.

What are the differing narratives posed by literary works of these periods, on the issues of territorial expansion, slavery, and national union; citizenship and democracy; social order and revolution? Reading widely and deeply, we'll study the writings of Charles Brockden Brown, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Emily Dickinson, Frederick Douglass; Herman Melville; Harriet Beecher Stowe; and Walt Whitman, among others.
