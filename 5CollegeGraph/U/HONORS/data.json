Through reading numerous in-depth case studies of seminal civil and criminal cases, we will explore such questions as: How and why have social movements used \"the law\" to advance their causes? What are the pros and cons of using litigation to achieve social change (or right a wrong), versus other tools such as direct action, lobbying, and community organizing? How have lawyers constrained or expanded the vision of social justice movements? What dilemmas do lawyers--who are ethically bound to zealously advocate for the interests of individual clients--face when they are additionally interested in advancing \"a cause\"? How effective is litigation in actually achieving the goals originally envisioned by lawyers, activists, and litigants? Cases explored may include issues such as civil rights, women's rights, free speech, GLBT rights, disability rights, environmental justice, criminal justice, poverty lawyering, immigration rights, and the rise of conservative social movement lawyering.\nJunior and Senior Commonwealth Honors College Students, others by permission of the Instructor.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n18017\n \n ","Department Code":"HONORS","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/SPRING/HONORS/397C/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(115, 16, 94)","size":10.0},{"label":"SPORTMGT-396H","x":167.0,"y":1.0,"id":"98","attributes":{"Title":"Hnr Indstu In SPORTMGT","Description":"Spring\n2015\nSport Management\n396H\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nContact the Bloom Honors Advising Center - 201 Commonwealth Honors College - to add this course\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n15238\n \n ","Department Code":"SPORTMGT","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/SPRING/SPORTMGT/396H/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(126, 40, 9)","size":10.0},{"label":"HISTORY-496H","x":11.0,"y":1.0,"id":"99","attributes":{"Title":"Hnr Indstu In Hist","Description":"Spring\n2015\nHistory\n496H\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nContact the Bloom Honors Advising Center - 201 Commonwealth Honors College - to add this course\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n11882\n \n ","Department Code":"HISTORY","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/SPRING/HISTORY/496H/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(118, 212, 182)","size":10.0},{"label":"HONORS-196","x":5.0,"y":1.0,"id":"100","attributes":{"Title":"Honors Independent Study","Description":"Spring\n2015\nHonors College\n196\nUMass Amherst\nInvolves frequent interaction between instructor and student.

We will examine the various creative processes artists use to create, explore the impulses and reasons behind artistic choices, attempt to determine where \"inspiration'' comes from, and discuss the ethical questions artists can face. We will begin the seminar with background readings to give us a theoretical grounding in creativity. We will then bring working artists into our seminar through guest speakers, pod-cast interviews, attending readings, performances, and films to further explore how artists work.

We will begin by examining various theories of human violence from a number of disciplines: anthropology, psychology, and sociology. Students will then survey different cultural attitudes towards violence beginning with several prehistoric sites from the American Southwest and northern Mexico. Next, the course will consider the historical roots of American violence starting with the European invasion of North America. Specific instances of violence in American history will also be considered, including the attempted genocide of American Indians, the enslavement of African Americans, and the American Civil War. The second half of the course will focus on a number of contemporary issues of American violence including race violence, hate crimes, violence against women, family violence, gang violence, and the violence in contemporary art and film.

Through field trips, guest speakers, written assignments, guided art-making activities in Studio 9, and a final art exhibition at 1350 Gallery, students will gain an overview of the development of Springfield?s identity through art. Field trips include visits to four historic art sites in downtown Springfield, each followed by a two-page written assignment in which students interpret and analyze the experience. There will be a final five-page written assignment based upon art and its impact on society, especially in Springfield. Each of the experiences will also be interpreted though art-making activities in Springfield?s Studio 9. A shuttle to Studio 9 and back to the Haigis Mall will be provided each Friday. By a guided analysis of the artists? ability to change the quality of life in the urban environment, students will develop their own understandings of what art means to them and how they think it contributes to society.

In spring semester 2015, we are partnering with the Mill River Greenway Initiative to develop interpretive tours and trailside materials along the Mill River, which runs through Northampton, Florence, Leeds, and Williamsburg, MA (http://millrivergreenway.org).   The first half of the course will involve skill-building: students will practice using historical maps and photographs, learn about GIS (geographic information systems), oral history interviewing, and website and exhibit design.  At the same time, students will be gaining background knowledge about the environmental history of the region, from early European settlement in the 18C through industrialization in the 19C through de-industrialization and environmental clean-up in the 20C.  The second half of the course will be primarily project based.
