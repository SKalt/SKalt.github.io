We will start with a broad survey of the city's history that began when William Pynchon and a company of Puritan men from Roxbury, founded Springfield in 1636 at the confluence of three rivers. Pynchon established a trading and fur-collecting post and enslaved Africans became a vital part of its labor force. Springfield officially became a city in May of 1852, but by then slavery had ended and the city had developed a reputation as a Underground Railroad depot thanks to antislavery freedom fighters like Thomas Thomas, Eli Baptist, and John Brown. Springfield's location at the crossroads of New England is the most significant reason for its economic progress as an industrial city. In 2010, Springfield was a city of 156,060, that was 22.3% Black or African American, and 4.7% from Two or More Races (1.5% White and Black or African American). Latinos of any race made up 38.8% of the population (33.2% Puerto Rican). It is a multicultural community, and is the regional center for banking, finance, and courts. Field trips to important sites, interviews with Ms. LaJuana Hood, founder of Springfield's Pan African Historical Museum USA, as well as other important culture bearers, will be special facets of the course. Community engaged research will be emphasized.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n60572\n \n ","Department Code":"AFROAM","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/AFROAM/297A/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(43, 203, 85)","size":10.0},{"label":"AFROAM-692F","x":10.0,"y":0.0,"id":"7","attributes":{"Title":"S-From Reconstruction to Renai","Description":"Fall\n2015\nAfro-American Studies\n692F\nUMass Amherst\nThis course examines African American literature and culture from the rise of Reconstruction through the onset of Jim Crow and the Great Migration to beginnings of the Harlem Renaissance.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n30556\n \n ","Department Code":"AFROAM","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/AFROAM/692F/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(43, 203, 85)","size":10.0},{"label":"AFROAM-196H","x":4.0,"y":1.0,"id":"8","attributes":{"Title":"Hnr Indstu In Afroam","Description":"Spring\n2015\nAfro-American Studies\n196H\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nContact the Bloom Honors Advising Center - 201 Commonwealth Honors College - to add this course\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n10528\n \n ","Department Code":"AFROAM","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/SPRING/AFROAM/196H/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(43, 203, 85)","size":10.0},{"label":"AFROAM-396ISH","x":11.0,"y":0.0,"id":"9","attributes":{"Title":"Hnr Indstu In Afroam","Description":"Spring\n2016\nAfro-American Studies\n396ISH\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nStudents must apply through CHC PATHS to add this course   To add this course, find a faculty sponsor with whom to plan your work.

Sparked by the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in Stanford, Florida, and Zimmerman's acquittal as well as the police killings of other black men and women, including Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, and Freddie Gray, this movement challenges police violence and other policing that makes black communities unsafe as well as social constructions of black people as inherently dangerous and criminal. Police violence against black people and the interrelated criminalization of black communities have a long history, older than the US itself. There is a similarly long and important history of activism and social movements against police violence and criminalization. Today, black people are disproportionately subject to police surveillance and violence, arrest, and incarceration. So, too, are other people of color (both men and women) and queer, trans, and gender nonconforming people of all races but especially those of color. This course will examine the history of policing and criminalization of black, queer, and trans people and communities and related anti-racist, feminist, and queer/trans activism. In doing so, we will interrogate how policing and understandings of criminality - or the view that certain people or groups are inherently dangerous or criminal - in the US have long been deeply shaped by race, gender, and sexuality.\nMeets with WOMENSST 295P\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n40684\n40754\n \n ","Department Code":"AFROAM","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/AFROAM/295P/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(43, 203, 85)","size":10.0},{"label":"AFROAM-702","x":65.0,"y":0.0,"id":"67","attributes":{"Title":"Major Work Afro-Am Studies II","Description":"Spring\n2016\nAfro-American Studies\n702\nUMass Amherst\nAn intensive study of fifty major works of Afro-American studies.

The series premiered on cable channel HBO in 2002 and lasted for five seasons. The Wire has been described by many critics as the greatest television series ever made and one of the most accomplished works of fiction of the 2000s. The show is recognized for its realistic portrayal of urban life, its literary ambitions, and its uncommonly deep exploration of sociopolitical themes. \nEach season of The Wire focused on a different facet of the city of Baltimore: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media. Drawing upon academic sources as well as select, screened episodes from The Wire, this course will focus on contemporary urban America, with special attention paid the illegal drug trade as well as failing school systems. The structural roots of, and response to many urban problems?involving institutionalized racism, urban renewal, deindustrialization, and the ?war on drugs? pursued by the Nixon and Regan administrations?will also be examined.\nQuizzes, a take-home midterm, and a final exam will be required.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n79404\n \n ","Department Code":"AFROAM","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2014/FALL/AFROAM/170/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(43, 203, 85)","size":10.0},{"label":"AFROAM-326","x":72.0,"y":0.0,"id":"74","attributes":{"Title":"Black Women in U.S. History","Description":"Fall\n2015\nAfro-American Studies\n326\nUMass Amherst\nThe history of African American women from the experience of slavery to the present.

Sparked by the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in Stanford, Florida, and Zimmerman?s acquittal as well as the police killings of other black men and women, including Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, and Freddie Gray, this movement challenges police violence and other policing that makes black communities unsafe as well as social constructions of black people as inherently dangerous and criminal. Police violence against black people and the interrelated criminalization of black communities have a long history, older than the US itself. There is a similarly long and important history of activism and social movements against police violence and criminalization. Today, black people are disproportionately subject to police surveillance and violence, arrest, and incarceration. So, too, are other people of color (both men and women) and queer, trans, and gender nonconforming people of all races but especially those of color. This course will examine the history of policing and criminalization of black, queer, and trans people and communities and related anti-racist, feminist, and queer/trans activism. In doing so, we will interrogate how policing and understandings of criminality - or the view that certain people or groups are inherently dangerous or criminal - in the US have long been deeply shaped by race, gender, and sexuality.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n40754\n40684\n \n ","Department Code":"WOMENSST","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/WOMENSST/295P/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(177, 6, 136)","size":10.0},{"label":"AFROAM-494DI","x":84.0,"y":0.0,"id":"89","attributes":{"Title":"DuBois Senior Seminar","Description":"Fall\n2015\nAfro-American Studies\n494DI\nUMass Amherst\nAFROAM 494DI is an upper-division course that provides a structured context for students to reflect on their own learning in their General Education courses and the courses they have taken in the AFROAM major.
