Sparked by the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in Stanford, Florida, and Zimmerman's acquittal as well as the police killings of other black men and women, including Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, and Freddie Gray, this movement challenges police violence and other policing that makes black communities unsafe as well as social constructions of black people as inherently dangerous and criminal. Police violence against black people and the interrelated criminalization of black communities have a long history, older than the US itself. There is a similarly long and important history of activism and social movements against police violence and criminalization. Today, black people are disproportionately subject to police surveillance and violence, arrest, and incarceration. So, too, are other people of color (both men and women) and queer, trans, and gender nonconforming people of all races but especially those of color. This course will examine the history of policing and criminalization of black, queer, and trans people and communities and related anti-racist, feminist, and queer/trans activism. In doing so, we will interrogate how policing and understandings of criminality - or the view that certain people or groups are inherently dangerous or criminal - in the US have long been deeply shaped by race, gender, and sexuality.\nMeets with WOMENSST 295P\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n40684\n40754\n \n ","Department Code":"AFRO","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2015/FALL/AFROAM/295P/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(39, 28, 30)","size":10.0},{"label":[22,"AFROAM-696A"],"x":23.0,"y":0.0,"id":"(22, 'AFROAM-696A')","attributes":{"Title":"IS-Qualifying Examination","Description":"Spring\n2016\nAfro-American Studies\n696A\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n60533\n \n ","Department Code":"AFRO","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/AFROAM/696A/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(39, 28, 30)","size":10.0},{"label":[23,"AFROAM-196H"],"x":2.0,"y":1.0,"id":"(23, 'AFROAM-196H')","attributes":{"Title":"Hnr Indstu In Afroam","Description":"Spring\n2015\nAfro-American Studies\n196H\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nContact the Bloom Honors Advising Center - 201 Commonwealth Honors College - to add this course\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n10528\n \n ","Department Code":"AFRO","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2015/SPRING/AFROAM/196H/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(39, 28, 30)","size":10.0},{"label":[24,"AFROAM-151"],"x":24.0,"y":0.0,"id":"(24, 'AFROAM-151')","attributes":{"Title":"Literature & Culture","Description":"Fall\n2015\nAfro-American Studies\n151\nUMass Amherst\nRelevant forms of Black cultural expressions contributing to the shape and character of contemporary Black culture; the application of these in traditional Black writers.

We will start with a broad survey of the city's history that began when William Pynchon and a company of Puritan men from Roxbury, founded Springfield in 1636 at the confluence of three rivers. Pynchon established a trading and fur-collecting post and enslaved Africans became a vital part of its labor force. Springfield officially became a city in May of 1852, but by then slavery had ended and the city had developed a reputation as a Underground Railroad depot thanks to antislavery freedom fighters like Thomas Thomas, Eli Baptist, and John Brown. Springfield's location at the crossroads of New England is the most significant reason for its economic progress as an industrial city. In 2010, Springfield was a city of 156,060, that was 22.3% Black or African American, and 4.7% from Two or More Races (1.5% White and Black or African American). Latinos of any race made up 38.8% of the population (33.2% Puerto Rican). It is a multicultural community, and is the regional center for banking, finance, and courts. Field trips to important sites, interviews with Ms. LaJuana Hood, founder of Springfield's Pan African Historical Museum USA, as well as other important culture bearers, will be special facets of the course.

There is a similarly long and important history of activism and social movements against police violence and criminalization. Today, black people are disproportionately subject to police surveillance and violence, arrest, and incarceration. So, too, are other people of color (both men and women) and queer, trans, and gender nonconforming people of all races but especially those of color. This course will examine the history of policing and criminalization of black, queer, and trans people and communities and related anti-racist, feminist, and queer/trans activism.

We will read short histories of both peoples, studies that focus on examples of historic interactions, and studies comparing leading figures of both groups. Most of the reading will center on the 20th century i.e. India during the periods of colonization, anti-colonization, and independence; and on African Americans from emancipation to the end of legal segregation.\nThere is a rich and rapidly growing scholarship on these topics so view this seminar as an opening to a complex and important topic. Good books to read, discussion format, class presentation on one of the books, final paper.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n68952\n \n ","Department Code":"AFRO","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/AFROAM/597E/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(39, 28, 30)","size":10.0},{"label":[86,"AFROAM-692F"],"x":83.0,"y":0.0,"id":"(86, 'AFROAM-692F')","attributes":{"Title":"S-From Reconstruction to Renai","Description":"Fall\n2015\nAfro-American Studies\n692F\nUMass Amherst\nThis course examines African American literature and culture from the rise of Reconstruction through the onset of Jim Crow and the Great Migration to beginnings of the Harlem Renaissance.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n30556\n \n ","Department Code":"AFRO","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2015/FALL/AFROAM/692F/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(39, 28, 30)","size":10.0},{"label":[87,"AFROAM-696"],"x":84.0,"y":0.0,"id":"(87, 'AFROAM-696')","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study","Description":"Spring\n2016\nAfro-American Studies\n696\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n60525\n \n ","Department Code":"AFRO","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/AFROAM/696/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(39, 28, 30)","size":10.0},{"label":[88,"AFROAM-693T"],"x":85.0,"y":0.0,"id":"(88, 'AFROAM-693T')","attributes":{"Title":"TA Mentoring Seminar","Description":"Fall\n2015\nAfro-American Studies\n693T\nUMass Amherst\nMentoring seminar for teaching assistants in Afro-American Studies.\nOpen to AFROAM Master's and Doctoral students only.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n40783\n \n ","Department Code":"AFRO","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2015/FALL/AFROAM/693T/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(39, 28, 30)","size":10.0},{"label":[89,"AFROAM-161"],"x":86.0,"y":0.0,"id":"(89, 'AFROAM-161')","attributes":{"Title":"Intro Afro-Amer Political Sci","Description":"Spring\n2015\nAfro-American Studies\n161\nUMass Amherst\nA survey of the politics of black people and their struggle for citizenship rights from 1787 to the present.
