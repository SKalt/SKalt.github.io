Readings in Italian available for Italian majors.\n Italian bread, Italian seasoning, Italian herbs, Italian breadcrumbs, Italian sausage, Italian vinaigrette, and finally \"Ristorante Italiano\" appear to refer, outside of Italy, to a concept of Italian cuisine that is universally recognized, though very generic and undefined. From the Alps to the coasts of Sicily, over the centuries, Italy has produced countless individual culinary traditions, which express themselves through local products, recipes, rituals, and cooking techniques. Though clearly distinct from each other, these traditions do share a sense of belonging to a national cuisine - loosely identified with the Mediterranean diet - of international recognition, which has in its dramatic diversity and almost infinite variety, its most distinctive traits. The local traditions that make Italian cuisine are the result of the interaction between centuries of history that have forged Italian culture and identity, and a territory that has shaped the inhabitants who are deeply rooted in it. This course will investigate possible strategies to elaborate a credible definition of \"Italian cuisine\" that is applicable to food in Italy as well as outside the country.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n69148\n \n ","Department Code":"ITALIAN","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/ITALIAN/397K/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(112, 210, 241)","size":10.0},{"label":"ITALIAN-280HH","x":4.0,"y":0.0,"id":"4","attributes":{"Title":"Language Suite Conv (colloq)","Description":"Spring\n2016\nItalian Studies\n280HH\nUMass Amherst\nMultiple required components--lab and/or discussion section.

We will analyze the deployment of 'reality' on screen from the post WWII neorealist redemptive project after Fascism, through the contaminated narrative explorations of artists like Pier Paolo Pasolini and Michelangelo Antonioni, to modern documentary forms and hybrids (docufictions, infotainment) and television's twisted tales of reality in the era of Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset.

This is due to the lively cultural debate that took place on dozens of literary periodicals that sprung up all over the Nation. Evidently, this was the result of the urgent need felt by intellectuals, often young and highly engaged, to create new opportunities outside the formal academic context to share ideas and participate in the cultural debate of one of the most interesting and exciting eras of Italian and European history. This course will provide a synchronic view of this cultural debate as it happened in real time through the pages of some of the most representative periodical publications during the first six decades of the last century, from the pre-WWI years to the immediate WWII aftermath. Born around the tables of literary cafes in Florence, Rome, or Turin and animated by the newest literary theories, artistic avant-garde movements, and social and political turmoil, literary periodicals offered an open forum to Italian intellectuals to share ideas and to explore and interact with the other European cultures, at a time - such as the fascist ventennio - of strict cultural nationalism and censorship. The UMass and Five College libraries offer an outstanding collection of literary periodicals.

Periodicals in Italy","Description":"Fall\n2015\nItalian Studies\n597LP\nUMass Amherst\nThe 20th century in Italy is often referred to as \"the century of periodicals\". This is due to the lively cultural debate that took place on dozens of literary periodicals that sprung up all over the Nation. Evidently, this was the result of the urgent need felt by intellectuals, often young and highly engaged, to create new opportunities outside the formal academic context to share ideas and participate in the cultural debate of one of the most interesting and exciting eras of Italian and European history. This course will provide a synchronic view of this cultural debate as it happened in real time through the pages of some of the most representative periodical publications during the first six decades of the last century, from the pre-WWI years to the immediate WWII aftermath. Born around the tables of literary cafes in Florence, Rome, or Turin and animated by the newest literary theories, artistic avant-garde movements, and social and political turmoil, literary periodicals offered an open forum to Italian intellectuals to share ideas and to explore and interact with the other European cultures, at a time - such as the fascist ventennio - of strict cultural nationalism and censorship.\nPrereq: Italian 324 or 325\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n39327\n39326\n \n ","Department Code":"ITALIAN","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/ITALIAN/597LP/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(112, 210, 241)","size":10.0},{"label":"ITALIAN-696","x":43.0,"y":0.0,"id":"44","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study","Description":"Spring\n2016\nItalian Studies\n696\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nOpen to Graduate students only.\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n62251\n \n ","Department Code":"ITALIAN","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/ITALIAN/696/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(112, 210, 241)","size":10.0},{"label":"ITALIAN-500U","x":44.0,"y":0.0,"id":"45","attributes":{"Title":"IS-Student Teaching","Description":"Spring\n2015\nItalian Studies\n500U\nUMass Amherst\nContact department for description.\nVaries from 3 to 12 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n12045\n \n ","Department Code":"ITALIAN","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/SPRING/ITALIAN/500U/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(112, 210, 241)","size":10.0},{"label":"ITALIAN-297A","x":8.0,"y":3.0,"id":"46","attributes":{"Title":"ST-IntermediateItalianColloq","Description":"Spring\n2015\nItalian Studies\n297A\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time.\nStudents must be registered for Italian 230.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n29228\n \n ","Department Code":"ITALIAN","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/SPRING/ITALIAN/297A/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(112, 210, 241)","size":10.0},{"label":"ITALIAN-496","x":45.0,"y":0.0,"id":"47","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study","Description":"Spring\n2016\nItalian Studies\n496\nUMass Amherst\nNot available at this time\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n62245\n \n ","Department Code":"ITALIAN","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/ITALIAN/496/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(112, 210, 241)","size":10.0},{"label":"ITALIAN-325","x":11.5,"y":4.0,"id":"48","attributes":{"Title":"Introduction to Italian Lit II","Description":"Spring\n2015\nItalian Studies\n325\nUMass Amherst\nThe course will provide an overview of some of the major Italian literary works of the modern times, from the 1600s to contemporary times.
