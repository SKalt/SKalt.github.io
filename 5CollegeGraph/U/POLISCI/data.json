Unequal access to quality health care is certainly part of the explanation in a country where, even after the new health care reform legislation, some 25 million Americans will have no insurance. But other factors are at work that are related to health as well: our relatively high income inequality, our stubbornly persisting patterns of residential segregation, our food environment and uneven educational system, to name a few.

It starts with an overview of the political history of early Islam, and then moves to examine the two traditions that have been formative of Islamic political thought and whose influence could be felt up until the present. The first of these traditions consists in Islamic theological and juristic writings on the nature and mandate of the legitimate Islamic state, or the Caliphate; the second comprises the works of medieval Muslim philosophers whose theorizations of the ideal body politic were influenced by the philosophical systems of Plato and Aristotle, as well as the Neo-Platonic trends that pervaded the Hellenistic period. These two traditions overlap; indeed, many Muslim philosophers were also jurists and theologians, most markedly al-Ghazali and Ibn-Rushd. However, to be able to discern the intersections between these two traditions, we will first have to distinguish between their respective approaches to politics and situate their interventions in their specific historical and political contexts.\nWe shall closely examine the works of Muslim thinkers to assess how they formulate the relationship between human reason and revelation, how they conceive of legitimate political rule, and how they visualize the relationship between the ruler and the ruled.

Democratic principles at home (public discussion in the assembly) coexisted with an empire that, ultimately, came to naught after the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. This is the context of this course, which is designed as an examination of major topics in Plato and Aristotle's philosophy as well as in some of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides' tragedies. We will begin with dialogues that concentrate on the method of questioning (elenchus) displayed by the historical Socrates in order to see its value as well as its possible limits. Socrates' method will be compared to other expressions of the Athenian ethical discourse as represented the tragedians. The tragic insistence on moderation, the dangers associated with political power, and the unreliability of a transcendental realm will offer a counterpoint to Socrates' and Plato's ideas of personal excellence and knowledge. We will conclude with Aristotle's reflections on the polls, which mark an important critique of Plato's philosophy.\nOpen to Commonwealth Honors College students or Seniors and Juniors.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n18255\n \n ","Department Code":"POLISCI","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/SPRING/POLISCI/395H/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(55, 232, 251)","size":10.0},{"label":"POLISCI-340","x":149.0,"y":0.0,"id":"156","attributes":{"Title":"Latin American Politics","Description":"Spring\n2016\nPolitical Science\n340\nUMass Amherst\nOverview of major approaches to the study of Latin American politics and survey of historical and contemporary democratic, populist, authoritarian, and revolutionary regimes.

Yet, women's progress in terms of achieving elected office has reached a puzzling plateau since the 1990s.  \nWe will examine the course of women's movements towards achieving political incorporation in the United States. We consider the debate over why women's political progress has stagnated and we consider the impact of the gender imbalance in American electoral politics - to what extent do these disparities matter?\nWe begin by exploring women's suffrage campaigns and voting behavior in the period immediately following their achievement of the right to vote and beyond. We then turn to the relationship between women and party politics before discussing the challenges women face as candidates in American politics. We will focus on understanding why women remain underrepresented as legislators.

Framing is a process by which certain aspects of an issue or event are emphasized, while other aspects are de-emphasized or ignored. These choices are often strategic, aimed at persuading a particular audience or influencing public opinion at large. In other cases, framing may be purely reflexive, as when a communicator has come to view a given issue through a prism shared with other members of a community and regards competing frames as disingenuous \"spin.\" The bottom line is that framing is inevitable in communicating and understanding the meaning of events in broader context. After reviewing some social scientific theories about how framing occurs, and reading framing analyses conducted by a number of scholars, students will have an opportunity to do their own original research. They will choose a public policy or set of events, identify various ways that it has been framed, and analyze differences in the relative prominence of these distinct frames across sources or over time.\nOpen to Commonwealth Honors College students, Political Science sophomores, or seniors and juniors in any major.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n40268\n \n ","Department Code":"POLISCI","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/POLISCI/391FPH/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(55, 232, 251)","size":10.0},{"label":"POLISCI-121H","x":162.0,"y":0.0,"id":"172","attributes":{"Title":"World Politics","Description":"Spring\n2015\nPolitical Science\n121H\nUMass Amherst\nIntroduction to the principles and practices of international relations in the political, military, economic, and environmental realms.
