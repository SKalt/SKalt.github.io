You'll learn how to integrate and apply knowledge from the four core areas of the ENVIRSCI curriculum. The main learning goals for this course are to gain in-depth experience in identifying tools and planning solutions for environmental challenges, and to explore how integrating your diverse educational experiences leads to new levels of understanding. You will learn how to address environmental management problems caused by global change, pollution, and the unsustainable use of renewable and non-renewable resources. The semester culminates in team-based projects in which students investigate connections between current environmental issues, their education in your ENVIRSCI major and your experience as UMass undergraduates, with structured opportunities for reflection on both your discipline and on yourself as a life-long scholar.
