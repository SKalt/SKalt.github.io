First, the concepts of state, ideology, class, commodification, capitalist crises, and emancipation are central. Most of the readings embrace some version of historical materialism (the idea that social history is driven by material conditions) and the unity of theory and practice (that the point of theory is to change the world). Second, some of what we read will be in explicit conversation around Marxist theory or concepts, though the authors may not necessarily identify with the Marxist tradition, or perhaps they did earlier on in their work before rejecting or transcending the label. Further, far from taking an uncritical view of Marxian ideas, the readings generally critique and in their own way reconstruct the tradition.\nOpen to Graduate Sociology majors only.

Yet young people are often negotiating restrictive institutions, including oppressive educational environments, media sexualization and exploitation, familial control, and increasing criminalization. Engaging with critical approaches to youth cultures, we will examine both the structural conditions that have shaped adolescence as the phase in the life course most associated with delinquency, deviance, and risk in today's society, as well as the diverse strategies young people have developed in resistance to the cultural constraints on their lives.\nCourse fulfills Crime, Law& Dev distribution requirement and CJ certificate elective.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n78948\n \n ","Department Code":"SOCIOL","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2014/FALL/SOCIOL/397K/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(118, 115, 115)","size":10.0},{"label":"SOCIOL-596","x":74.0,"y":0.0,"id":"54","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study","Description":"Spring\n2016\nSociology\n596\nUMass Amherst\nContact department for description.\nVaries from 1 to 6 credits\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n66992\n \n ","Department Code":"SOCIOL","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/SOCIOL/596/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(118, 115, 115)","size":10.0},{"label":"SOCIOL-351","x":75.0,"y":0.0,"id":"55","attributes":{"Title":"S-Social Network & Analysis","Description":"Spring\n2016\nSociology\n351\nUMass Amherst\nSocial networks are commonplace in our everyday world and increasingly relevant online.
