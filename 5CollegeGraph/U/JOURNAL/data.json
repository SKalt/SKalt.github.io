Why? Communications and media play a critical role in political and social change. They help to create community, shape public opinion, expand and constrict public memory, and inform current political discourse. The narratives that survive from our past shape our perception of who we are and how our world works. But there are also narratives that get shoved aside and ignored. One goal of this course is to revive some of those discarded stories and present a broader, deeper, and more complicated view of African American history. Additionally, we will consider the way African American history has been retold and re-imagined over time by political actors and other who were eager to make use of it in our nation's political discourse.

That journalism has been profoundly impacted by the development of Web 2.0 applications is nowadays axiomatic. However, the precise ways in which such ?new media? phenomena as Facebook & Twitter, the personal blog and the smart phone have transformed news gathering, packaging and dissemination still need to be researched and understood. Students will reflect critically on the manner in which their communication (e.g., their use of language, imagery and technology) creates and, in turn, is determined by, the social and cultural world(s) in which they live. Investigating their meaning-making processes in this way should translate into an increased awareness of the causes and consequences of their storytelling choices. The course readings will deal with such issues as identity formation, social and cultural diversity, linguistic and technological determinism, ritual, perception and subjectivity, and cultural competency.
