Biological oceanography is the study of marine organisms, and is an interdisciplinary subject that integrates biology with chemistry, physics and geology.  The goal of this course is to understand the factors controlling the quantitative abundance and distributions of marine organisms in space and time and their interactions with each other and the surrounding environment.  This course examines marine organisms, from phytoplankton and zooplankton to nekton and large marine mammals, and life in all realms of the ocean from surface waters to the deep sea, including hydrothermal vent systems.  The biotic and abiotic factors that contribute to the distribution of the organisms is investigated.  This course also examines the important role that primary productivity in the oceans plays in regulating global nutrient cycles and Earth's climate, and how climate change and pollution are currently affecting the different ocean ecosystems.  A significant part of this course is based on field observations and experiments and on laboratory experimentation with individual species or isolated parts of the system being studied.

The platform of the course uses real-world Geoscience problems facing societies and cultures, incorporating the themes of Water, Air, Energy, Climate and Sustainability. Using readings, print and on-line media, students are encouraged to work through the ways in which integration of their diverse educational experiences leads to new levels of understanding. The semester culminates in team-based projects in which students investigate connections between current Geosciences issues, their education in their major and their experience as UMass undergraduates, with structured opportunities for reflection on both their discipline and themselves as life-long scholars.

Over the last two decades, surface water and groundwater have increasingly been viewed as a single resource, producing a myriad of new and exciting scientific work on the subject. The quantity and quality of surface water can affect the volume and chemistry of groundwater, and vice versa.  Interactions between these are crucial to understanding the ecosystems that depend on them, the processes governing hydrologic systems, and effective resource assessment and management practices. In this course you will learn in-class and field-based techniques for the quantification of surface water - groundwater interactions, explore the scientific literature investigating the interfaces between disciplines encapsulated by hydrologic and geologic systems and ecosystems. The class will examine a current issue related to surface water - groundwater interactions, and collectively, will provide concrete recommendations for addressing the issue in a final report.\nYou will learn:\n- To measure exchange of surface water and groundwater in the field (two fieldtrips)\n- The experimental basis and fundamental theories behind established and new methods for quantifying the relationship between surface water and groundwater\n- To think critically about assumptions about the connection (or lack thereof) between surface water and groundwater\n- Current findings and developing knowledge in the scientific literature\n- To address a real-world problem using tools from your knowledge of surface water - groundwater interactions developed in this course\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n64393\n \n ","Department Code":"GEO-","Course Site":"<a href= '/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/GEO-SCI/691GW/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(108, 221, 203)","size":10.0},{"label":[65,"GEO-SCI-631"],"x":6.0,"y":1.0,"id":"(65, 'GEO-SCI-631')","attributes":{"Title":"Brittle Fracture Analy","Description":"Spring\n2016\nGeosciences\n631\nUMass Amherst\nStudy of faults, dikes, joints, veins, solution surfaces, and other fractures using field, analytical, and numerical techniques.
