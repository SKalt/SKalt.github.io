Over the last two decades, surface water and groundwater have increasingly been viewed as a single resource, producing a myriad of new and exciting scientific work on the subject. The quantity and quality of surface water can affect the volume and chemistry of groundwater, and vice versa.  Interactions between these are crucial to understanding the ecosystems that depend on them, the processes governing hydrologic systems, and effective resource assessment and management practices. In this course you will learn in-class and field-based techniques for the quantification of surface water - groundwater interactions, explore the scientific literature investigating the interfaces between disciplines encapsulated by hydrologic and geologic systems and ecosystems. The class will examine a current issue related to surface water - groundwater interactions, and collectively, will provide concrete recommendations for addressing the issue in a final report.\nYou will learn:\n- To measure exchange of surface water and groundwater in the field (two fieldtrips)\n- The experimental basis and fundamental theories behind established and new methods for quantifying the relationship between surface water and groundwater\n- To think critically about assumptions about the connection (or lack thereof) between surface water and groundwater\n- Current findings and developing knowledge in the scientific literature\n- To address a real-world problem using tools from your knowledge of surface water - groundwater interactions developed in this course\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n64393\n \n ","Department Code":"GEO","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/GEO-SCI/691GW/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(240, 52, 111)","size":10.0},{"label":"GEO-SCI-517","x":36.0,"y":1.0,"id":"17","attributes":{"Title":"Sedimentary Geochemistry","Description":"Fall\n2014\nGeosciences\n517\nUMass Amherst\nWith lab, field trip.

The goal of this course is to understand the factors controlling the quantitative abundance and distributions of marine organisms in space and time and their interactions with each other and the surrounding environment.  This course examines marine organisms, from phytoplankton and zooplankton to nekton and large marine mammals, and life in all realms of the ocean from surface waters to the deep sea, including hydrothermal vent systems.  The biotic and abiotic factors that contribute to the distribution of the organisms is investigated.  This course also examines the important role that primary productivity in the oceans plays in regulating global nutrient cycles and Earth's climate, and how climate change and pollution are currently affecting the different ocean ecosystems.  A significant part of this course is based on field observations and experiments and on laboratory experimentation with individual species or isolated parts of the system being studied.
