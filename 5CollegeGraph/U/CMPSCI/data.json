seminar examines recent work in explanatory and tutoring systems. Participants study artificial intelligence in education, a young field that explores theories about learning, and explores how to build software that delivers differential teaching as it adapt its response to student needs and domain knowledge. Such software supports people who work alone or in collaborative inquiry, students who question their own knowledge, and students who rapidly access and integrate global information. This course describes how to build these tutors and how to produce the best possible learning environment, whether for classroom instruction or lifelong learning.  The objective of the course is to stimulate awareness of research issues and to promote sound analytic and design skills as they pertain to building knowledge representations and control strategies. Specific topics include collaboration, inquiry, dialogue systems, machine learning, simulators, authoring tools and user models.  The course is appropriate for students from many disciplines (computer science, linguistics, education, and psychology), researchers, and practitioners from academia, industry, and government. No programming is required. Students read and critique tools, methods, and ideas, learn how artificial intelligence is applied (e.g., vision, natural language), and study the complexity of human learning through advances in cognitive science.\nOpen to Graduate students only.   4 SEATS ARE RESERVED FOR MA EDUC MAJORS.

These applications require a broad range of conceptual understanding ranging from user interface design and client/server-side concepts and programming to caching, monitoring, scalability, and performance issues. These techniques need to work collectively to bring the end user a single working system. Unlike traditional waterfall methods of software development that demand a focus on design before development, agile development emphasizes techniques that require an iterative design, development, and deploy process. Test driven development is the focus and a working system is always available for review. This 1 credit course will require students to be managers that lead a software development team (students enrolled in 497S) to the successful completion and deployment of a real web application.

As computing appears everywhere in daily life, computational techniques could help us understand key social scientific questions. But also, since computing is becoming more social, insights from social science may help us design better systems for users. This seminar will consist of readings and presentations on (1) social media analysis, and (2) computational social science. Social media is one interesting and recent manifestation of computation in everyday life, and lends itself to studies on topics from mental health to the evolution of slang to the emergence of fads to the dynamics of social unrest. This data's richness and magnitude (\"Big\"-ness) requires non-trival computational methods for analysis, and comes with major questions about validity and representativeness. At the same time, we will investigate the social science literature and consider techniques and insights that may help achieve a deeper understanding of these phenomena, and better appreciate the important questions to ask. Furthermore, we will look at case studies of applying computational methods (like text analysis / NLP, network analysis, latent-variable statistical models, agent-based simulations, etc.) to understand social phenomena in other contexts. These have been developed in many other areas than just CS. For example, in the 1980's, political scientists developed what we would now call an unsupervised machine learning method to infer the ideological positions of legislators from their voting behavior, in order to answer questions about the structure of American politics. Work like this might inspire us to think of how related methods aid insight in other areas.\nOpen to PhD-CMPSCI students only.   LECT 01=3 CREDITS; LECT 02=1 CREDIT.

In reality, web applications and services are extremely difficult to get right. They involve complicated user interfaces, multiple databases, security holes and performance issues, and a multitude of ever changing remote services, spread across several physical and virtual machines. These complications are further stressed by the large number of concurrent users that access these applications every second.  This complexity leads to failed applications, performance bottlenecks, and security breaches. This course focuses on all areas of building scalable web systems. Topics include the study of cyber security, big data, system design, best practices, redundancy, scalability, performance and monitoring, and key principles in the agile development of complicated distributed web applications. Students will work as a team to design, develop, monitor, and analyze a large and scalable web application.
