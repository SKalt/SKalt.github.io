This course will begin by examining the transnationalization of U.S. history from its roots in the 1890s to its recent resurgence in the wake of the Organization of American Historians' 1996 Project on Internationalizing the Study of American History. We will then investigate U.S. slavery and secession, including the roles played by the Haitian Revolution, West Indian Emancipation, nationalism, unification, and separatist movements in Europe. We will then turn to the war itself, studying its place in 19th-century warfare, foreigners in the armies, and diplomacy. Finally, we will study U.S. Reconstruction in light of transnational trends creating new racial and labor practices and political regimes. Along the way, we will examine different historians' approaches and methodologies that seek to link the local, national, and the global.

This period would be seen as a golden age by the philosophes of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and the founders of the history of science in the twentieth century. Yet the period from 1550 to 1650 also saw widespread interest in occult powers and natural magic, and it was the height of the \"witch craze\" in Europe, a period in which about fifty thousand Europeans, most of them women, were executed for the crime of diabolical witchcraft.  Are these trends contradictory or complementary? Historians have disagreed vehemently about whether the Scientific Revolution, a triumph of rational thought, was opposed to the Renaissance interest in the occult, demonology, natural magic, and witchcraft, or whether these aspects were part and parcel of the intense study of the natural world that characterized early modern science. For example, Isaac Newton was both the founder of modern physics and a dedicated alchemical adept. Were these aspects of his life compatible? Or did they coexist in an uneasy tension, reflected in the fact that Newton never published his alchemical writings?\nThis course will address these questions on the basis of intensive study of the primary sources and intellectual, cultural and social history and the history of science. Though our focus will be on early modern Europe, we will look to the High Middle Ages for the origins of many European concepts of demonic and occult powers and the origins of modern notions of scientific explanation. On the most fundamental level, this course is about the history of reason and rationality: what did it mean to approach a problem reasonably, and what - if anything - did modern science add to the ways in which human beings justify their claims to know something?\nOpen to Doctoral & Masters students only.

The second section is organized thematically and explores a variety of themes (including gender, space, the idea of the tropics, science, and the imperial archive) that are prominent in contemporary scholarship of colonialism and imperialism.

This period would be seen as a golden age by the philosophers of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and the founders of the history of science in the twentieth century. Yet the period from 1550 to 1650 also saw widespread interest in occult powers and natural magic, and it was the height of the \"witch craze\" in Europe, a period in which about fifty thousand Europeans, most of them women, were tried and executed for the crime of diabolical witchcraft.  Are these trends contradictory or complementary? Historians have disagreed vehemently about whether the Scientific Revolution, a triumph of rational thought, was opposed to the Renaissance interest in the occult, demonology, natural magic, and witchcraft, or whether these aspects were part and parcel of the intense study of the natural world that characterized early modern science. For example, Isaac Newton was both the founder of modern physics and a dedicated alchemical adept. Were these aspects of his life compatible? Or did they coexist in an uneasy tension, reflected in the fact that Newton never published his alchemical writings? This course will address these questions on the basis of intensive study of the primary sources and selected readings from modern historians of science, European culture, and occult knowledge. Though our focus will be on early modern Europe, we will look to the High Middle Ages for the origins of many European concepts of demonic and occult powers and the origins of modern notions of scientific explanation. On the most fundamental level, this course is about the history of reason and rationality: what did it mean to approach a problem reasonably, and what - if anything - did modern science add to the ways in which human beings justify their claims to know something?\nOpen to Seniors, Juniors & Sophomores only.

And yet, in most states, it remains legal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, and public accommodations and LGBT people still experience violence in their families, on the streets, and in schools.  This course will examine the history of LGBT people in the United States through the lens of the law.  We will explore a host of legal issues facing LGBT people in the last fifty years, such as sodomy laws, employment discrimination, school bullying, health law issues, particularly those related to HIV/AIDS and transgender health care, and family law issues, such as child custody, adoption, and marriage.  Some questions we might consider include:   When and why have LGBT people turned to the courts or legislatures for redress of legal grievances and to what success?  What claims have LGBT people made for legal protection and how has it mattered whether these claims have been based on equality, liberty, or privacy arguments?  In what ways has the use of \"the law\" by the LGBT movement to achieve social justice been different from and similar to other \"rights\" movements, such as the civil rights movement, the women?s rights movement, and the disability rights movement?  What conflicts have arisen over legal goals and strategies between the LGBT \"movement\" and LGBT people?   What role have lawyers historically played in advancing (or constraining) the goals of the LGBT movement and how effective has litigation been in securing these rights?  Does (or will) legal equality for LGBT people mean justice or liberation for LGBT people?  How has the lived legal experience of LGBT people differed on the basis of other social and legal categories, such as sex, gender, race, class, ability, or immigration or incarceration status?

We will reconsider and reevaluate major issues in Modern art and culture such as the evolution of personal expression, the recognition of non-western culture in Euro-America, the interest in abstraction as a universal language, new technologies in art, the politics of the avant-garde and its attempts to reconnect art and life, issues of gender, race and representation, the role of myth and the unconscious, and the dialogue between art and popular culture.\nThis course meets with ART-HIST 324\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n38243\n38244\n \n ","Department Code":"ART","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/ART-HIST/624/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(36, 7, 209)","size":10.0},{"label":"HISTORY-395S","x":15.0,"y":0.0,"id":"154","attributes":{"Title":"History/SocPolcy/PolGendRaceCl","Description":"Fall\n2015\nHistory\n395S\nUMass Amherst\nWhat are the problems associated with developing equitable and just policy?

Museums have traditionally accepted the values of the cultures that created and organized them, often a century ago, and have limited their collections, messages, and audiences to serve those values. In this course, we will examine the ways in which many of today's museums are moving beyond their original missions to become socially relevant institutions unafraid to discuss hard truths about the past, to engage in a dialogue with the public about how the past has shaped the present, and to imagine new futures. We will look at case studies of museum that accept the role of being the trusted place where people go to learn and to connect after a community or national trauma and address enduring social issues in new ways by serving as a neutral ground for dialogue about equity. Museums are living up to their responsibilities as ADA-compliant institutions by offering inclusive experiences for disabled persons, including those with learning, sensory, social, and cognitive disabilities.

First, how did people construct their own sense of peoplehood, and second, how did people construct that of others? Greek and Roman understandings of ethnicity were deeply rooted in the authority of texts and continued to define peoples, communities, and territories throughout antiquity.
