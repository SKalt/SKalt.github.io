This period would be seen as a golden age by the philosophes of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and the founders of the history of science in the twentieth century. Yet the period from 1550 to 1650 also saw widespread interest in occult powers and natural magic, and it was the height of the \"witch craze\" in Europe, a period in which about fifty thousand Europeans, most of them women, were executed for the crime of diabolical witchcraft.  Are these trends contradictory or complementary? Historians have disagreed vehemently about whether the Scientific Revolution, a triumph of rational thought, was opposed to the Renaissance interest in the occult, demonology, natural magic, and witchcraft, or whether these aspects were part and parcel of the intense study of the natural world that characterized early modern science. For example, Isaac Newton was both the founder of modern physics and a dedicated alchemical adept. Were these aspects of his life compatible? Or did they coexist in an uneasy tension, reflected in the fact that Newton never published his alchemical writings?\nThis course will address these questions on the basis of intensive study of the primary sources and intellectual, cultural and social history and the history of science. Though our focus will be on early modern Europe, we will look to the High Middle Ages for the origins of many European concepts of demonic and occult powers and the origins of modern notions of scientific explanation. On the most fundamental level, this course is about the history of reason and rationality: what did it mean to approach a problem reasonably, and what - if anything - did modern science add to the ways in which human beings justify their claims to know something?\nOpen to Doctoral & Masters students only.

The second section is organized thematically and explores a variety of themes (including gender, space, the idea of the tropics, science, and the imperial archive) that are prominent in contemporary scholarship of colonialism and imperialism.

This period would be seen as a golden age by the philosophers of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and the founders of the history of science in the twentieth century. Yet the period from 1550 to 1650 also saw widespread interest in occult powers and natural magic, and it was the height of the \"witch craze\" in Europe, a period in which about fifty thousand Europeans, most of them women, were tried and executed for the crime of diabolical witchcraft.  Are these trends contradictory or complementary? Historians have disagreed vehemently about whether the Scientific Revolution, a triumph of rational thought, was opposed to the Renaissance interest in the occult, demonology, natural magic, and witchcraft, or whether these aspects were part and parcel of the intense study of the natural world that characterized early modern science. For example, Isaac Newton was both the founder of modern physics and a dedicated alchemical adept. Were these aspects of his life compatible? Or did they coexist in an uneasy tension, reflected in the fact that Newton never published his alchemical writings? This course will address these questions on the basis of intensive study of the primary sources and selected readings from modern historians of science, European culture, and occult knowledge. Though our focus will be on early modern Europe, we will look to the High Middle Ages for the origins of many European concepts of demonic and occult powers and the origins of modern notions of scientific explanation. On the most fundamental level, this course is about the history of reason and rationality: what did it mean to approach a problem reasonably, and what - if anything - did modern science add to the ways in which human beings justify their claims to know something?\nOpen to Seniors, Juniors & Sophomores only.

We will explore a host of legal issues facing LGBT people in the last fifty years, such as sodomy laws, employment discrimination, school bullying, health law issues, particularly those related to HIV/AIDS and transgender health care, and family law issues, such as child custody, adoption, and marriage.  Some questions we might consider include:   When and why have LGBT people turned to the courts or legislatures for redress of legal grievances and to what success?  What claims have LGBT people made for legal protection and how has it mattered whether these claims have been based on equality, liberty, or privacy arguments?  In what ways has the use of \"the law\" by the LGBT movement to achieve social justice been different from and similar to other \"rights\" movements, such as the civil rights movement, the women?s rights movement, and the disability rights movement?  What conflicts have arisen over legal goals and strategies between the LGBT \"movement\" and LGBT people?   What role have lawyers historically played in advancing (or constraining) the goals of the LGBT movement and how effective has litigation been in securing these rights?  Does (or will) legal equality for LGBT people mean justice or liberation for LGBT people?  How has the lived legal experience of LGBT people differed on the basis of other social and legal categories, such as sex, gender, race, class, ability, or immigration or incarceration status?

The temporal scope of this course incorporates the pre-conquest era (before 1492) and the wars of independence in the nineteenth century. The principal focus of discussion, however, is the era of Spanish conquest and the nearly three centuries of Spanish colonial rule (ca. 1530 to 1809). Reading and discussion centers on prominent themes and debates in recent historiography on the colonial Andes. The dynamics of conquest, the creation and characteristics of colonial urban environments, the transformation of religious patterns and thought,  the role of slavery in Andean colonial society, patterns of rebellion and resistance, and debates over the emergence of Spanish American consciousness are just a few of the themes this course addresses.
