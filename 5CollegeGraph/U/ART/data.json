It offers an opportunity for art history majors, students of architecture and landscape history as well as those interested in the history of education, to delve into the origins, present and future of the American campus.  Colleges and universities represent a unique entry point for studying the architectural history of the United States and one that has immediate relevance.  Students will explore the origin and evolution of the built environment in which they spend their daily lives.  The course will begin with an historical overview of early campus architecture and design, and include a look at the Oxbridge example in England for certain precedents. We will examine the influence of Olmsted and the Beaux Arts tradition in planning as well as the work of specific architects, from Joseph Ramee and Thomas Jefferson to Walter Gropius and Louis Kahn, and their contributions to collegiate design. Discussion and research will include key architectural developments but we will also look in depth at social and cultural shifts affecting the designs of campuses such as the education of women and, more recently, the emphasis on environmental design and sustainability.
