Although Polish and Russian belong to the same linguistic family of Slavic languages and hence share some cultural affinities, historically Poland and Russia have occupied two opposing ends on the geopolitical spectrum. Both countries experienced great historical upheavals and collective traumas: foreign invasions, loss of statehood, revolution, world wars, and the violence of Fascism and Stalinism. The theme of History as impersonal violence is represented in the literature of both countries and is often juxtaposed by a traditional love story, the quintessential experience of individual life. While reading representative works from each tradition, we will try to explore the relationship between history (as impersonal force) and love (meaning of individual life). Under Communism, the state in both countries targeted writers to legitimize the ruling ideology by imposing censorship. Often Polish and Russian writers defied state censorship in their work by relying on allusion, irony, parody, political satire, and metaphor to comment on the complex political and cultural reality in which they lived. Keeping in mind their distinct histories and cultural traditions, we will read works by major twentieth century Polish and Russian writers to see what other common philosophical themes and artistic concerns can be traced in the cultural production of these two neighboring Eastern European countries. Among the Russian writers we will read Borys Pasternak, Evgeny Zamyatin, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Mikhail Bulgakov, Osip Mandelshtam, and Tatyana Tolstaya. Writers from the Polish tradition will include Bruno Schulz, Slawomir Mrozek, Stanislaw Lem, Wislawa Szymborska, Pawel Huelle, and Olga Tokarczuk.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n30683\n \n ","Department Code":"COMP","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2015/FALL/COMP-LIT/391LW/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(153, 86, 206)","size":10.0},{"label":"COMP-LIT-592A","x":24.0,"y":1.0,"id":"15","attributes":{"Title":"S-Medieval Women Writers","Description":"Spring\n2016\nComparative Literature\n592A\nUMass Amherst\nSelected medieval women writers from the point of view of current theoretical perspectives.

The course will introduce students to research in sociolinguistics and interpreting and translation studies and to a number of practical skills required of professional interpreters and translators. Interpreting and translation will be viewed throughout the course as socio-cultural activities as well as linguistic ones. The social, cultural and ethical complexities of the role of interpreters and translators will therefore be an important focus of the course. In Part I of the course, students will work with written and spoken texts to develop an understanding of micro-textual elements and macro-textual structures and patterns and understand how to analyze both written and spoken texts. They will also begin to develop listening skills using pre-recorded spoken texts. Role plays will be conducted to familiarize students with the triadic nature of interpreted communication.

The course is divided into four main sections: historical and theoretical questions; the voice in cinema; music in cinema; and contemporary sound design. The historical scope of the course will include the entire history of cinema sound, from the so-called \"silent\" era to the present; but we will focus on two particularly salient turning points: the introduction of synchronous sound film in the late 1920s and the deployment of Digital Surround Sound (DSS) systems in the 1990s. Assigned readings and case studies will provide a strong foundation for audio-visual analysis by equipping students with a critical vocabulary for communicating effectively about sound in cinema. As a means of further developing our critical ears, we will also be audio-viewing and discussing a group of self-reflexive films that take sound technology as their subject. Such films may include Singin' in the Rain (Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, 1952), The Conversation (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974), Blow Out (Brian De Palma, 1981), Berberian Sound Studio (Peter Strickland, 2012), and Hacked Circuit (Deborah Stratman, 2014). Examining the ways in which these and other self-reflexive films narrate or express certain potentials and anxieties particular to sound recording and representation will help us to better understand the social and cultural meanings associated with mediated sound and listening in various contexts.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n79469\n \n
