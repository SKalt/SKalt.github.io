The seminar and its related activities are designed to serve two complementary goals: 1) honing students' skills and expanding their understandings of the connections between a whole student approach and undergraduates academic success, and 2) building leadership competence and sensibilities that will extend well beyond the context of advising, preparing students to become insightful, skilled, and ethical leaders in a complex social world. We will examine modes of communication (including one-to-one communication, small group facilitation, social media use, and public speaking), identities (including race, culture, sexuality, gender, and social class), and late adolescent/adult development (including transitions into and out of college, shifting priorities across the lifespan, and the weave of cognitive, social, and emotional development). This is a service learning course designed to scaffold students' development as visionary professionals and engaged citizens able to analyze individual, group, organizational, and societal phenomena in nuanced and socially responsible ways.

The word \"folklore\" usually refers to traditional expressive practices, ranging from verbal arts (such as proverbs and legends) to material culture (such as costumes and handicrafts) to customs (such as rituals and festivals). But as this class demonstrates, the study of folklore has changed over the years. We now recognize that all communities, not just traditional ones, have folklore. Similarly, we now understand folklore to be an ever-evolving phenomenon that responds to its time of creation and speaks to the future. Alongside conceptual frameworks, this class also introduces students to the ethnography of folklore performances; that is, it asks them to practice methods of studying both special events and everyday expressions of self. Key ideas in this class include community, identity, tradition, worldview, and power. It will examine four general approaches to folklore studies: a focus on genres, groups, performances, and critical perspectives. It introduces students to various theories of interpreting folklore and encourages them to understand it as a form of artistic communication that serves significant political and ethical purposes.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n70061\n \n ","Department Code":"COMM","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/COMM/297CF/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(115, 164, 133)","size":10.0},{"label":"COMM-DIS-697A","x":109.5,"y":1.0,"id":"39","attributes":{"Title":"ST:Instrumentation in Audiolog","Description":"Fall\n2014\nCommunication Disorders\n697A\nUMass Amherst\nFundamental principles of electronic instrumentation with emphais on clinical and research applications in audiology.

Secondly we will work to dissect narrative structures, and the genre's uses of mise-en-scene, cinematography/ videography, editing, and sound to create specific images of the family through social constructions of race, class, and gender. In addition we will use various critical methods such as semiotics, genre study, ideological criticism, cultural studies, and so on to interrogate why the sitcom form since its inception in the 1950s has remained one of the most popular genres for audiences and industry personnel alike and assess what the genre might offer us in terms of a larger commentary on notions of difference and identity in the US and beyond.\nSatisfies the IE require for BA-Comm majors.\nOpen to Senior and Junior Communication majors only.

As the most material of substances, food literally matters for survival. While the need for food to satisfy hunger and strengthen the body is universally understood, what counts as food, its relative abundance or scarcity, and its relationship to the body, identity and culture are socially created and highly symbolic. Still for most people what we eat and why we choose to eat it seems the most common of ?common sense?. Meanings attached to what is edible or inedible, good or bad, nutritional or unhealthy, gourmet or junk food are highly subjective and deeply cultural. Throughout your university career you have had the opportunity to take courses that provided you with a variety of lenses for examining the ways people use language to make meaning of their worlds. How might you use some of the theories of concepts from these courses to examine your own food beliefs and practices and the consequences of those practices on your own and others' lives and livelihoods?

Like other forms of communication, music can be studied in terms of its texts, institutions, and audiences.  Unlike other forms of communication, music is best understood from an interdisciplinary perspective that deals with the physics of sound, human biology, and musicology. In addition to asking the question, \"What does the music mean?\" I urge you to ask:  What is the chain of biological, physical, social, and cultural events that render music meaningful and popular? What sorts of networks and emotional affiliations make musical performance/ consumption possible, whether it be a concert, film, public transport, shopping mall, Walkman, funeral, file sharing, etc.?

Schools, religious institutions, peer groups, and various community organizations now perform basic tasks of socialization, education, work, and recreation that were previously the domain of the family. Unlike most other external institutions, however, media come inside the home, bringing with them the most pervasive, common, and widely-shared images, perspectives, and values of our society (including those of the family itself), as they give shape and structure to family interaction patterns. At the same time, conceptions of what counts as \"a family\" are changing as never before, and new media technologies continually offer new ways for family members to communicate, both inside and outside of the home, shifting what \"family communication\" means in the process. This seminar explores existing theory and research in order to assess what we know about these transformations and to explore how we might be able to understand them better. What are the \"normative\" images of families presented in the media and what do they contribute to our beliefs and \"values\" about families? How do media influence family interaction? How do families mediate the effects of media? What about social networking, video games, cell phones, and other new technologies? With a major focus on assessing the quality and validity of existing empirical research, students will draw upon various approaches to research and constructions of family encountered in their GenEd courses, along with personal experiences with media in the family context. Requirements include written commentaries and oral presentations based on the readings, self-reflection papers, and a final (group) research project. Satisfies the Integrative Experience requirement for BA-Comm majors.\nOpen to Senior and Junior Communication majors only.
