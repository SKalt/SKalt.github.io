This coordination of mind and body results in the music that is heard. The better one's coordination, the more successful one can be in realizing the musical intention. Based on the Feldenkrais Method of Somatic Education, this course helps musicians to clarify how to translate thoughts into action, which can result in a more dynamic and expressive performance. In each class, students will participate in an Awareness Through Movement lesson. Each lesson consists of gentle, verbally-guided movement sequences, designed to improve body awareness and efficiency of movement. The underlying principles of these lessons can be applied directly to enhance performance and learning in a variety of settings. Students are required to write weekly journals to document their experiences and emerging discoveries that they will also share with their studio teacher. Grading is based on attendance and satisfactory completion of journal assignments.
