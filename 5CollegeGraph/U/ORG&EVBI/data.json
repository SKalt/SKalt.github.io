The course is intended particularly for students planning to apply for NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grants, but may be useful for students applying for other research grants as well.  Students will each write an independent grant proposal that will be peer-reviewed by a mock panel composed of student and faculty reviewers. A revised version will be due at the end of the semester that addresses panel comments. Lectures will provide information and advice regarding grantsmanship, funding opportunities, and application procedures.
