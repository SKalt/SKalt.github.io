Sign languages are, on a par with spoken languages, instantiations of universal grammar, but they use the visual-gestural modality. Investigating their properties can thus reveal aspects of grammar which remain unobservable in the oral signal, due to articulatory constraints and other limitations relative to the linearity of speech. Furthermore, a better understanding of sign languages and of their commonalities with spoken languages also helps determine what in the linguistic signal (oral or visual) is contingent upon the physical limitations imposed by the medium, and what is an expression of the essential properties of language cognition. The course will cover a selection of phenomena (in phonology, syntax and semantics) that are important for understanding the structure of sign languages.\nPre Req: LINGUIST 201\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n70348\n \n ","Department Code":"LINGUIST","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/UM/2016/SPRING/LINGUIST/397S/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(195, 217, 150)","size":10.0},{"label":"LINGUIST-752","x":38.0,"y":2.0,"id":"16","attributes":{"Title":"Topics In Syntax","Description":"Spring\n2015\nLinguistics\n752\nUMass Amherst\nAdvanced, intensive work on specific topics in syntax.

Linguistics has been at the heart of cognitive science since the 1950's, and it's often said that language provides a privileged window on the inner workings of the mind. Throughout this course, we ask what exactly we learn about the mind by studying language. We will examine two classic arguments from linguistics that have been taken as informative about the structure of the mind: the argument for mental grammar, and the argument for innate knowledge. Specific topics include the nature of phonological and syntactic grammar, numerical cognition, reference and noun-phrase syntax, color systems, theory of mind, and event representations.
