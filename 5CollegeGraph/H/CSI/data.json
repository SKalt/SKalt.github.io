But is there a need for a feminist economics, and if so, why? How is it different from mainstream economic analyses of gender inequality?  What does a feminist vision of an alternative economic system look like? This course explores these questions in depth.  The class will begin with a theoretical and empirical introduction to the goals and concerns of feminist economics.  Students will be introduced to mainstream economic explanations of gender inequality, and to feminist critiques of these.  We will then embark on an in-depth exploration of feminist economic theory, methodology, applications and policy prescriptions, and feminist visions of an alternative economic system.  The course will cover topics such as sex discrimination in labor markets, the economics of the household, caring labor, and the solidarity economy.\nIndependent Work Quantitative Skills Writing and Research Prerequisite:  At least one year of college-level course work.

This rise in numbers is largely caused by economic, political and other social policies, prompting Latin@s to reside into new regions, cities, and towns that were once hostile to them, accounting for new demographic shifts and thus, Remapping las Americas.  In the process, Latin@s have undeniably emerged as a significant political, cultural, economic and social force.    Utilizing an interdisciplinary, Critical Ethnic Studies and transnational framework, this course is designed as an introductory foray to studying Latin@ communities in the United States, focusing on their historical, social, political, cultural and economic formations and practices. Some issues and topics to be discussed include: the history of Latin@ Studies, inter-Latin@ and transnational formations, Latin@ identities and their attendant discourses; social and cultural movements; labor policies and (im)migrant labor migration; past and current xenophobic policies and practices against Latin@ communities; and the forms of resistance employed by Latin@s against historical and current-day imperial projects and ethnically/racially intolerant policies.\nPower, Community and Social Justice Multiple Cultural Perspectives Writing and Research\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n318307\n \n ","Department Code":"CSI","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/HC/2015/FALL/CSI/0101/1'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(78, 183, 115)","size":10.0},{"label":"CSI-0279","x":2.0,"y":0.0,"id":"2","attributes":{"Title":"Media and the Middle East","Description":"Fall\n2015\nCritical Social Inquiry\n0279\nHampshire College\nThe global media landscape has undergone significant changes in just over a decade.

What has been the political and social impact of Middle East-based channels with a global reach like Al Jazeera? How have new media influenced social movements as well as perceptions of historical events such as the Arab Uprisings?

At the same time, human rights movements emerged calling for the end of the abuses and demanding information about political prisoners, victims of torture, executions and disappearances. Once democratic transitions took place, these movements campaigned to demand the prosecution of those responsible for the abuses. What accounts for the different role and impact human rights movements had in each of these countries in the transition and consolidation of democracy, and the rule of law?

Gandhi remains a controversial figure. On one hand, he is celebrated as the father of the Indian nation and an apostle of non-violence, and on the other hand viewed as a wily politician and a patriarch with problematic views of gender and sexuality. In his lifetime, thousands saw him as a saint, while others (mainly Hindu nationalists) reviled him as a traitor to Indian nationalism and blamed him for the partition of India. This course investigates these multiple myths and images around Gandhi in order to understand which, if any of these, have any historical validity. Using Gandhi's own writings and the words of his contemporary admirers and detractors, it attempts to go beyond these binaries and instead explore his biography, his politics and his philosophy in their full complexity.\nPower, Community and Social Justice Independent Work Multiple Cultural Perspectives Writing and Research Students are expected to spend at least six to eight hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n319826\n \n ","Department Code":"CSI","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/HC/2016/SPRING/CSI/0130/1'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(78, 183, 115)","size":10.0},{"label":"CSI-0170","x":24.0,"y":0.0,"id":"24","attributes":{"Title":"Minding Culture","Description":"Fall\n2015\nCritical Social Inquiry\n0170\nHampshire College\nThis course will introduce students to the major controversies and discourses debated in the study of mental illness.

When do we begin our exploration---in the 1950s, 1960s or perhaps sooner?  Does the emergence of newly independent nations in Africa and Asia shape activist conceptions of civil rights, human rights, violence, nonviolence, citizenship or nation building?  How do the discourses and struggles of the 1960s animate our understanding of social change today?  Can studying the modern Civil Rights Movement help us to understand discourses of morality and family values in use today?

Troubling the relationship between fantasy, representation and the real, and empowering culture and the production of counter-realities to the dominant orders as sites and ground of resistance are hallmarks of postmodernism. So is the insistence that a materialist politics of redistribution cannot be separated from a \"cultural\" politics of recognition; and the view that complex identifications and differences productively undermine identity and identity politics; and that truth is a product not a ground of political struggle. The goal of this course is to trace the genealogies of these ideas as they have come to challenge the Left, while maintaining full affinities with a radical anti-capitalist project. We will read Harvey and Jameson, the Marxists most closely identified with exploring the contributions of postmodernism; Lyotard and Baudrillard, the \"ex-Marxists\" whose names are most associated with postmodernism; and consider the lineage Nietzsche, Foucault, Mbembe Butler. Depending on time, and class interest, we will also read Benjamin or Deleuze.

Arab nationalism and the American empire developed on the same timetable and influenced each other in subtle but profound ways. The United States at the dawn of its age of empire was far more aware of events in the Middle East than we generally realize today. As American global interests mushroomed, understanding the political developments in the Middle East became a necessity. However, several factors impeded the American understanding of Arab nationalism. Ethnocentrism and an American brand of Orientalism would make it hard for Americans see the real peoples of the Middle East, not the imagined inhabitants of the Holy Land. Even more importantly, Americans would never be able to grapple with the meaning of Arab nationalism without considering the challenges of yet another brand of nationalism, Zionism. In 1908, Zionism and nascent Arab nationalism first encountered each other on the American scene. Their continued encounters would shape political and intellectual developments in the United States and the Middle East for the hundred years that followed. That century is the focus of this course. Specific topics we will explore include the Turkish Revolution of 1908, Woodrow Wilson's response to Arab nationalism in the wake of World War I, World War II and America's response to the creation of the Arab League and the rise of Nasserism in the early Cold War, as well as the American response to Palestinian nationalism.

In this course, we will discuss how the Orientalist imaginary was realized, thus affording the east/west divide of the present. One key factor in the colonization and exploitation of the aforementioned spaces was the internalization of externally determined narratives of identity. As Mahmood Mamdani suggests, persons were defined and then ruled. Many of these identities linger in the contemporary, such that the colonial political relation has superficially dissipated, while the colonial mentality remains. The specter of colonialism continues to cause violence throughout the territories closest to the east/west divide, which allows for an ongoing exploitative relation with western powers. In more recent history a counter-Orientalist narrative has emerged in an effort to liberate or decolonize the colonial subject and ultimately stop these violent relations; thus, the bulk of this course will involve working with figures such as Edward Said, Hamid Dabashi, Joseph Massad, Talal Asad, Saba Mahmood, as well as many others who are often overlooked precisely because of the east/west power binary that they are working to undermine.\nIndependent Work Multiple Cultural Perspectives Writing and Research Students are expected to spend at least six to eight hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n318978\n \n ","Department Code":"CSI","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/HC/2015/FALL/CSI/0275/1'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(78, 183, 115)","size":10.0},{"label":"CSI-0291","x":43.0,"y":0.0,"id":"43","attributes":{"Title":"Oral Hist Theory/Method Pt II","Description":"Spring\n2016\nCritical Social Inquiry\n0291\nHampshire College\nThis is part II of the Oral History Theory and Method seminar that started during the Fall 2015 semester.

This course will explore the struggles of African American women to defend the integrity of their own bodies; these struggles include the fight against everyday insults embedded in the daily indignities of Jim Crow; the efforts of enslaved women to protect themselves and their children, as well as collective organizing against rape and sexual harassment in the early and mid-twentieth century. One example we will explore is the story of Margaret Garner, the real life, nineteenth century heroine whose story was the inspiration for Toni Morrison's Beloved. We will also explore recent scholarship that centers the fight to protect the integrity of black women's bodies and reshapes how we understand African American social movements.

The impact of the youth's online activism that bypasses political economic structures of academic and civil society institutions is examined along with interrogating how communities of exchange and action are formed as a result of using new media as tool for social transformation.\nPower, Community and Social Justice Multiple Cultural Perspectives Writing and Research Independent Work  Students are expected to spend at least six to eight hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n318970\n \n ","Department Code":"CSI","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/HC/2015/FALL/CSI/0154/1'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(78, 183, 115)","size":10.0},{"label":"CSI-0100","x":140.0,"y":0.0,"id":"140","attributes":{"Title":"Independent Study - 100 Level","Description":"Spring\n2016\nCritical Social Inquiry\n0100\nHampshire College\nTo register for an Independent Study with Hampshire College faculty you need to communicate the faculty member's name to your Registrar's office along with your Course Request and Instructor Permission form.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n319896\n \n ","Department Code":"CSI","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/HC/2016/SPRING/CSI/0100/0'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(78, 183, 115)","size":10.0},{"label":"CSI-0199","x":141.0,"y":0.0,"id":"141","attributes":{"Title":"Inscribing Knowledge","Description":"Spring\n2016\nCritical Social Inquiry\n0199\nHampshire College\nAfrica is known as the continent of orality. Notions of African antiquity as quintessentially pre-literate, non-literate or illiterate remain decidedly intact in the Western imaginary. Moreover, the widely held perception is Africa's lack of written traditions as known in other societies is evidence of Africa's lack of history, and in turn civilization. Still, documenting writing and graphic writing systems in the African past is not difficult: Egyptian hieroglyphics, Coptic texts in Egypt and Ethiopia, Vai script in Liberia, Bamum script in Cameroon, Nsibidi script in Cameroon and Nigeria, as well as Arabic and Ajami scripts throughout the continent. This introductory course explores African writing and graphic writing systems as materialized traces of knowledge central to the ways in which Africans construct and document ideas about themselves, others and the world around them.  Our focus will be the translation of non-visual forms of knowledge into visual, material representation. In this course, we will examine the means by which African writing and graphic writing systems synthesize ideas, thoughts and actions through the use of signs, symbols, pictorial and/or scripts, sometimes involving objects. We will consider the rise and fall of indigenous writing and graphic writing systems, in addition to the rejection and adoption of foreign writing systems. In particular, we will pay close attention to just how African writing and graphic systems contain potentials for political, economic and social gain, central to projects of domination, power, authority and agency, as well as inspire sacred, divine thoughts, as objects of devotion and worship.\nPower, Community and Social Justice Multiple Cultural Perspectives Writing and Research Students are expected to spend at least six to eight hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n319836\n \n ","Department Code":"CSI","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/HC/2016/SPRING/CSI/0199/1'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(78, 183, 115)","size":10.0},{"label":"CSI-0120","x":142.0,"y":0.0,"id":"142","attributes":{"Title":"Biography & Social Movements","Description":"Fall\n2015\nCritical Social Inquiry\n0120\nHampshire College\nThis course was designed to help students think critically about how historical narratives are constructed.  Biographies provide a compelling way to examine historical questions, debates and ways of attaching meaning to broader historical developments.  They offer a critical entry-point into constructing narratives that reflect the range and complexity of African American lived experiences.  This course will focus on the ways in which biographies enrich our understanding of migrations, radical organizing, the building of institutions, intellectual and political cultures while also gaining a glimpse into the everyday texture of life in African American Communities.  Some figures, such as Paul Robeson and W.E.B. Dubois, achieved prominence as activists and intellectuals during their lifetime.  Others accomplished a great deal as activists scholars but faded from our historical memory with time, such as Pauline Hopkins and Hubert Harrison.  One source, a diary that chronicles the struggles of Richelene Mitchell, is an insightful critique of the politics of poverty written by a woman not well known outside of her community.  We will pay particular attention to the sources and think carefully about the kinds of materials historians explore to construct a person's life.  Letters, newspapers articles, diaries and oral interviews will provide opportunities for students to raise questions and to develop interpretations of the evidence.  In other words, to think like an historian.\nPower, Community and Social Justice Multiple Cultural Perspectives Writing and Research Students are expected to spend at least six to eight hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n318310\n \n ","Department Code":"CSI","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/HC/2015/FALL/CSI/0120/1'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(78, 183, 115)","size":10.0},{"label":"CSI-0157","x":143.0,"y":0.0,"id":"143","attributes":{"Title":"Citizenship/Freedom","Description":"Fall\n2014\nCritical Social Inquiry\n0157\nHampshire College\nWe question, attempt to define and discuss different notions, and generally reflect upon what it means to lead a good life.

This course examines recent changes in the international economy, with a special focus on South-South relations. Some questions we will consider are: What will be the impact of the rise of Third World Capitalism on the global economy? What will the global economy look like when we emerge from the current financial crises? Does South-South cooperation hold the promise of an alternative model to neo-liberal globalization or is it best thought of as unity against Northern hegemony? How has colonialism previously and economic liberalization more recently changed the structure and pattern of trade among developing countries? In the course we will trace the historical patterns of trade among developing nations since the colonial era and then look closely at South-South cooperation in the post-WWII period.\nMultiple Cultural Perspectives Writing and Research Students are expected to spend at least six to eight hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time.
