College\nExplore the function of the endocrine system and its role in behavior, specifically as examined in animal model systems. The social, nutritional and sensory environment of an organism can dramatically affect the expression of specific hormones. Those hormones, in turn, can determine the development, degree of plasticity and output of the nervous system. Thus, the behavior of an organism is set in a background of endocrine influences. This course examines the endocrine system and how it interacts with the nervous system to influence behavior in a range of organisms. We'll start with the foundations of nervous and endocrine system physiology and anatomy with consideration of common methods and techniques in neuroendocrine and behavioral research. Then we will focus on some specific behaviors such as parental behavior, reproductive behavior, feeding, affiliation, and aggression. Students will analyze the primary scientific literature, write short papers and develop an independent paper that they present to the class. Experimental projects will be part of this course. 300-level students will act as team leaders for the course projects.\nWriting and Research Quantitative Skills Independent Work In this course students are generally expected to spend at least 6 to 8 hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n317018,317021\n317021\n \n ","Department Code":"NS","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/HC/2015/SPRING/NS/0389/1'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(248, 197, 206)","size":10.0},{"label":"NS-0104","x":1.0,"y":0.0,"id":"1","attributes":{"Title":"Optics and Holography","Description":"Fall\n2015\nNatural Science\n0104\nHampshire College\nThis course is an introduction to fundamental principles of optics as applied to image formation and holography.

Stands of trees covered less than 20% of Massachusetts. Now the reverse is true, and over 80% of the land is covered with young woods. The same kinds of trees are back, but the forests are substantially different and the impacts of human activity remain. Yet hidden within our second and third growth forests are patches of trees that were never clear-cut and in some cases were not cut at all. In those places, called \"old growth\" forests or \"historic woodlots,\" we can get a glimpse of what the pre-colonial woodland might have been like. We can study forest ecology in the absence of direct human disturbance. The significance of old woods and the ecology of the plants, animals, and soil organisms found on sites undisturbed by intense human activity are \"hot\" topics among conservationists and forest managers alike. In this course, we will visit old growth sites, learn how to identify, age, and census trees, and how to read the history of a site. We will locate and map special trees, soils and plants.

This debate seems to beg several crucial questions: what food, for whom, produced how and where, at what cost to the world's non-human biota (among others)?  We might try to answer these questions politically, or ethically, or ecologically - in this class I propose to explore the implications of our food choices and production methods as quantitatively as possible using mathematical models.  Many, many studies have produced models of this kind, so we have a good set of starting points.  And, a model is only as good as its input data, and the validity of assumptions about rates and interrelationships.  We will explore and critique a few such models, then try out our own project.  Depending on interests, skills and available information we might take on local food production and consumption on our own campus, in the Pioneer Valley, or even throughout the world.

As such, it is an essential subject for those interested in growth and decay processes, motion, and the determination of functional relationships in general. Using student-selected models from primary literature, we will investigate dynamical systems from economics, ecology, epidemiology and physics. Computers are essential tools in the exploration of such processes and will be integral to the course. No previous programming experience is required. Topics will include: 1) dynamical systems; 2) basic concepts of calculus -- rate of change, differentiation, limits; 3) differential equations; 4) computer programming, simulation, and approximation; 5) exponential and circular functions. While the course is self-contained, students are strongly urged to follow it up by taking NS 261-Calculus II to further develop their facility with the concepts. In addition to regular substantial problem sets, each student will apply the concepts to recently published models of their choosing.\nPhysical and Biological Sciences Quantitative Skills In this course students are generally expected to spend at least 6 to 8 hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n318179\n \n ","Department Code":"NS","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/HC/2015/FALL/NS/0260/1'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(248, 197, 206)","size":10.0},{"label":"NS-0388","x":88.0,"y":0.0,"id":"88","attributes":{"Title":"Adv Methods in Mol Biology","Description":"Fall\n2015\nNatural Science\n0388\nHampshire College\nThis course is intended for Div III and advanced Div II students who are committed to proposing, developing, or carrying-through research projects involving techniques commonly used in a molecular biology lab.

Those hormones, in turn, can determine the development, degree of plasticity and output of the nervous system. Thus, the behavior an organism can have is sometimes determined by the endocrine constraints on the nervous system. This course examines the endocrine system and how it interacts with the nervous system to influence behavior in a range of organisms, including humans. We'll start with the foundations of nervous and endocrine system physiology and anatomy with consideration of common methods and techniques in neuroendocrine and behavioral research. Then we will focus on some specific behaviors such as parental behavior, reproductive behavior, feeding, affiliation, aggression, learning, and memory.
