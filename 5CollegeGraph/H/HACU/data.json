College\nThis course investigates the imaginative, mythic, historical, and aesthetic meanings of \"America,\" from its earliest incarnations through the mid-nineteenth century, and the ways in which the \"national imaginary\" has continually been challenged, shaped and pressured by the presence of radical and marginal groups and individuals. We will read both major and unfamiliar works of the colonial, revolutionary, early republic and antebellum years, and examine how these works embody, envision, revise, and respond to central concepts and tropes of national purpose and identity. Our conversations will address the spiritual and religious underpinnings of American nationhood; exploration, conquest, and nature; notions of individualism, progress, improvement, and success; race, ethnicity, class, and gender; alternative nationalisms and communities.

The Transcendentalists also produced some of the richest and most original literature of the nineteenth century. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to explore in depth the principal writings of the Transcendentalists in their distinctive literary, religious, and historical settings; and to examine these texts reflexively for what they may say to us today. While sampling other writings of the period, we will read extensively in the work of three premier literary and cultural figures: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, and Henry David Thoreau.

Moreover, why do eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British writers invariably put gothic tropes to work in novels that lay claim to realism?  The seminar pursues a cultural-historical answer to these questions by considering the forms of subjectivity that the gothic both authorizes and renders phobic.  The course concludes by investigating our ongoing fascination with the gothic as evident in contemporary reinterpretations of zombies, vampires, viruses, and other forms of mass life.

Were events ranging from unforeseen personal tragedies to economic investments to imperial rises and falls guided by chance or by an all-seeing God?

How do we render meaninglessness in fiction without making it meaningful? Are we satisfied with literature that doesn't explain itself? Can we read without trying to explain? This course will examine novelists grappling with these questions as they try to find place for literature in the modern world. In a century marked by drastic technological advances in communication, transportation, and warfare - changes that also characterize our historical moment - modernist and post-modernist novelists experimented with incorporating meaninglessness into their work through innovation of the form of the novel as well as expansion of its content. We will read authors from different national traditions who try to incorporate the failure of meaning into their texts. This course will incorporate literary theories of modernism, post-modernism, and the novel to help us understand how narrative conventions promise meaning and how the 20th-century experimental novel subverts this promise.

Yet we are increasingly aware of photography produced by people on the African continent. This photography workshop will investigate the many ways photographers (mostly African but also non-African) have made photographs in Africa and will use these practices as blueprints for reimagining the possibilities of what a camera can do. Some questions we will address include: What are the historic relationships between the camera, nationalism, race, the outsider and agency? How can artists glean tools from faraway and use them for their own purposes in a very different context? What else can you do with a camera? Using examples from around the continent and throughout photographic history that vary in form, technique and concept, we will create a framework that takes practices developed in Africa as an origin of photographic inquiry.\nMultiple Cultural Perspectives Independent Work Prerequisite: 1 intro photography course or equivalent, 1 critical or cultural studies course; Recommended: 1 200 level course in either the humanities or social sciences  Students are expected to spend approximately 4 hours weekly in preparation and work outside of class time.\nMultiple required components--lab and/or discussion section.

If AfroFuturism evolved out of a particular political context where are we now? Looking globally we see that there seems to be a bigger archive, the concept has traveled across continents, and the canon has expanded for popular audiences. In the African context there is a desire to take on post- colonial history and find other images and frameworks to intervene into the present.

How do we queer the concept - or is it already queer? How do we engage with a feminist lens? How do we interpret the notion of post-race in this discussion?

We will examine how the ambition for political power impacted the development of certain artistic and architectural canons, what state-sponsored art can tell us about ruling regimes and power relations, how propaganda in art and architecture affected society and historical events and how our own preconceptions and modern concerns about propaganda, media, and political manipulation color our own approaches to ancient culture. Students will examine the following issues; the nature and meaning of propaganda; pictorial narrative and the fabrication of history; the role of art and architecture in fashioning rulers' public political images; art as a means of communicating rulers' ideologies; conceptions and representations of the enemy; and public spectacles and rituals as propaganda.\nIndependent Work Multiple Cultural Perspectives Quantitative Skills Writing and Research In this course, students are expected to spend 10 hours weekly on preparation and work outside of class time.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n316902\n \n ","Department Code":"HACU","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/HC/2015/SPRING/HACU/0231/1'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(10, 46, 16)","size":10.0}]}
