Students - hopefully with a range of interests from gaming and computer science to design, theatre and history - will identify a dead medium, a term first proposed by the science fiction writer Bruce Sterling. They will then spend the term conducting an archeology of it: exploring its actual historical experience, perhaps embroidering on it through inventive fantasy, maybe building a model and examining how its story might have relevance for the near-term media future.

While there is a broad consensus among biologists about the common descent of humans from prior species and the processes that drive biological evolution, public debates continue over the validity of evolution. According to the latest Gallup poll, 42% of Americans believe in a creationist view of human origins, and there are constant efforts by various school boards across the country to include some form of creationism in biology classes. Despite all the scientific evidence, why is biological evolution at the center of public debates today? In this course, we will look at sociological, psychological, and cultural factors that shape the public reception of evolution in the US and abroad. We will also look at the reliability of polling surveys and will conclude the course by analyzing the role of media in public evolution debate, from the Scopes Trial to the recent debate between Bill Nye and creationist, Ken Ham.\nMind, Brain, and Information Writing and Research In this course, students are expected to spend at least six to eight hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time.
