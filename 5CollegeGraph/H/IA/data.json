Should they? When reading a play, to what does a designer respond? Theme, character, dialogue, stage directions, place, time, rhythm, flow, and arcs all play into a designer's process of discovering the visual and aural possibilities of texts. How does a designer sift through the body of a script and discover clues of the physical nature of the play? This course focuses on reading plays with design in mind. We will read and discuss selected plays. Students will research period and aesthetic styles, lead discussions, present initial design ideas for each play, and work in design teams.

It was at the very least a response to what was, in Breton's view, an increasingly oppressive intellectual and social milieu. Surrealism, Breton tells us, \"leads to the permanent destruction of all other psychic mechanisms and to its substitution for them in the solution of the principal problems of life.\"  Breton's ideas were especially attractive to Martiniquan poet and political figure Aime Cesaire. For Cesaire, surrealism seemed a logical model for decolonizing land as well as mind, for what Cesaire termed \"a refusal of the shadow.\" In this course, we examine the relationships between surrealism and Cesaire's notion of negritude, and how these two modes impacted successive generations of poets of the African diaspora.  We'll frame our discussion within the larger context of Black cultural responses to slavery, colonization, and the legacies of each.

This course is primarily targeted toward students who are working on large research projects for Division II and Division III. This is a co-curricular class.\nWriting and Research In this course, students are expected to spend at least six to eight hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time on work-in-process for other classes, independent study projects, or divisional exams.

And how does an actor manifest it? This course examines the work of the actor through a hands-on, experiential approach, focusing on the body, voice, and imagination. The course begins with an exploration of the body, and how one's physical form can be both a text and a jumping off point to create visual poetry on stage. We will then move to naturalistic scenes as a way to develop tools of text analysis, character development, and receiving and sending action. Essential to all our exploration is the principle that dynamic life on stage is found not within oneself but in relationship to scene partners, an ensemble, and the audience.\nArts, Design, and Media Independent Work In this course, students are expected to spend at least six to eight hours a week of preparation and work outside of class time.

What are the tools writers use to create their characters, and how do we talk about character in historical fiction? Are we looking for a portrayal that in some way complements our understanding of a time and place, one that challenges it, or both? The focus will be on critical reading and writing, as well as on creating your own original works of fiction, for which you will need to do research, all while keeping in mind that you are not writing a text book but a narrative.

In some cultures, the arts are valued like math, science and other academic subjects and they are an indispensable part of the general education curriculum.
