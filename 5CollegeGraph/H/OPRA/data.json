During the forceful annexation of Okinawa to the main island of Japan in the late 19th century, any individual with a working comprehension of hand-to-hand combat was considered a threat to the Japanese military incursions.  Training and practice of karate had to be held in secret and late at night. No previous experience in any martial art is required for this class. Students will explore and practice the basics (kihon) of standing, blocking, striking and kicking.  Using balance, timing and coordination we will begin to thread these individual techniques into larger sequences of movements called kata (forms).  Within each kata resides the origin of combat with regard to one or more opponents.  Students will engage in paired exercises using isolated techniques from the kata to form basic drills of sparring (kumite). Beginning students will have the opportunity to observe OR participate in the semi-annual Kyu Test taking place at the end of each semester for formal feedback on their technique.

To be an archer meant you were beholden to defending your lord's stronghold from distant threats.  After the era of great civil war had ended in Japan by 1600 A.D., samurai warriors were at a loss for a way to keep current their military tactics.  The need to repurpose the paradigm of their fighting and destructive methods caused the samurai to shift towards scholastic pursuits, religion and philosophy. Students will encounter a standing form of Zen meditation or Ritsuzen, by way of the Japanese bow.  At the beginning level, students will concentrate on learning the first step-by-step form called Shichido, or The Seven Coordinations.  This precise form is the basic method of firing a single arrow in one meditative instance.   Students will begin with a comprehensive briefing of the equipment and practice of simulated shooting with no target. Regular practice of live shooting at short distance will occur after individual sessions of the \"First Shot\" procedure.
