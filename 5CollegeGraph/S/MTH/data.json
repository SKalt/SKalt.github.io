Techniques for analyzing both quantitative and categorical data are discussed. Applications are emphasized, and students use SPSS and other statistical software for data analysis. Classes meet for lecture/discussion and a required laboratory that emphasizes the analysis of real data. This course satisfies the basis requirement for the psychology major. Students who have taken MTH 111 or the equivalent or who have taken AP STAT should take SDS 220, which also satisfies the major requirement. Enrollment is restricted to psychology majors or permission of instructor.
