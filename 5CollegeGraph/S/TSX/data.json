The seminar readings focus on renowned practitioners' reflections on the difficulties and complexities of translating, the obstacles, discoveries and solutions that the translator encounters. We read a series of essays that engage with the conflicting interpretations and nuances of translations in 14 languages of Ferdinand Oyono's iconic 1956 African novel, \n We compare how these translations transform the original novel and question the concept of original text as it interacts with the culture and the language into which it is translated. Students are responsible for presenting essays that focus on the particular challenges of translation that they have encountered in their individual project. Enrollment limit of 12 students.\nInstructor permission.   Not open to first-years, sophomores\nPermission is required for interchange registration during all registration periods.\n41084-S16\n \n ","Department Code":"TSX","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/SC/2016/SPRING/TSX/340/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(167, 173, 215)","size":10.0}]}
