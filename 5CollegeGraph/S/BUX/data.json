Taught by a Tibetan Lharampa Geshe, this is an experientially-based class presenting a challenging, interactive, and energetic approach to metaphysical and cosmic questions. Students get a brief overview of the Tibetan debate system and an opportunity to participate in a debate forum. Meets first half of semester only.
