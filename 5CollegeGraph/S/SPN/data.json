Many Latin American filmmakers have addressed questions of human rights and national trauma. This seminar reflects on the role of films in debates over these issues, on their importance for the preservation of memory, and also on how they impact the relationship of later generations to past traumas. Studying films from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil and Peru, the course focuses on two periods: first, the 1980s and early 1990s, when many countries were overcoming repressive regimes or civil wars; and second, the years since the early 2000s, marked by the globalized ways of filmmaking in our times.\nTopic: Human Rights, Memory and Post-Memory in Latin American Films.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n18830-F15\n \n ","Department Code":"SPN","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/SC/2015/FALL/SPN/372/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(229, 167, 126)","size":10.0},{"label":"SPN-251","x":6.0,"y":3.0,"id":"18","attributes":{"Title":"SURV IBERIAN LIT,ART,SOCIET II","Description":"Spring\n2016\nSpanish\n251\nSmith College\nA society and its artistic and cultural journeys is examined through the eyes of writers and other artists and intellectuals who lived both in Spain itself as well as in exile.
