As critics such as Edward Said have long made clear, from the late medieval period until the 19th century the encounter between the West and China has also been predominantly one-sided. One of the earliest encounters was through the well-documented travels of the Venetian merchant Marco Polo. Seven centuries later, Italian film directors seem to have continued that tradition and have been among the first Westerners to make full-length films in the People's Republic of China. By examining Italian films made in China and, more recently, films made in Italy about Chinese immigrants, we examine changing cultural perceptions about China and how ideological assumptions manipulate cinematic production and experiences.\nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n41496-S16\n \n ","Department Code":"ITL","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/SC/2016/SPRING/ITL/281/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(128, 5, 131)","size":10.0},{"label":"ITL-111","x":2.0,"y":3.0,"id":"5","attributes":{"Title":"ACCELERATED ELEM ITALIAN I","Description":"Spring\n2016\nItalian Language & Literature\n111\nSmith College\nOne-semester course designed for students who might have missed the opportunity to take our highly recommended yearlong ITL 110y course.
