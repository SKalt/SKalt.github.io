This course considers the formation and interrogation of national identities in three post-colonial settings: Angola, Brazil and Cuba. Our readings and discussion focus on notions of race, culture and hybridity in the narration of these national identities. How do different artists and intellectuals respond to the urge for national, cultural and racial unity in the face of dramatic diversity? How do they respond to the racialized legacies of colonialism and Eurocentrism? How does privileging the hybrid, mulatto, creole or mestizo/mestico identity both subvert and reinvent sociocultural and aesthetic hierarchies? The focus is on fiction and poetry but also includes film, music and visual culture, as well as readings on sociohistorical contexts. Course taught in English. Students have the option of doing selected readings and written work in Spanish and/or Portuguese. Enrollment limited to 12.\nTopic: Angola, Brazil, and Cuba: Race, Nation, and Narrative.
