The course has an optional laboratory (BMX 101) that meets Mondays and Wednesday evenings during the first four weeks of the course. The laboratory introduces students to writing scripts in a software program that are used in the two BMX 100 research modules. BMX 100 includes two research modules, offered Monday evenings only during weeks 5 through 13 of the semester. Each module introduces students to a biomath research question. Students work in groups to collect or examine biological data and investigate modeling and analytical tools that address the biological questions posed. Each module is co-taught by two faculty members, one from the life sciences and one from the quantitative sciences. The emphasis throughout the course is on formulating lines of inquiry and learning to develop and test conceptual models. Students may register for BMX 100 only or BMX 100 and 101.
