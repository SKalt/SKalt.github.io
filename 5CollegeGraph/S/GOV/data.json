Beginning with the work of John Rawls and his critics, we move to examine the debates raised by Rawls in the works of other authors who take seriously his idea of building a just society for all. Special attention is paid to the politics of inclusion for groups based on race, gender, sexual orientation and ethnicity as their claims for rights/justice/inclusion present challenges to our rhetorical commitment to build a just and fair society for all.

While the specific technologies suggested in such work might not be available now (or perhaps ever), the speculative exercise undertaken by such works can help us to better understand the possibilities of the present.
