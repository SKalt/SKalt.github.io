In the course of the semester, we come to a fine-grained understanding of (1) the cultural and social milieu of the northeastern United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and (2) the art institutions of the time, such as the radical Society of American Artists, from which Seelye purchased a number of paintings. Students engage in intensive study of works of American art in the museum, as well as key paintings that left the collection in a massive sale of American art in 1947.
