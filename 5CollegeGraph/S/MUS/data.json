Music has also provided powerful commentary of war, articulating human pain and protest in equal measure. In this class we consider these functions in key works of art and popular music of the 19th and 20th centuries -- a period of nationalism, revolution and two world wars -- as well as our own contemporary experience with the war in Iraq. We discuss music of war; about war; and in the shadow of war. \nPermission is required for interchange registration during the add/drop period only.\n41508-S16\n \n ","Department Code":"MUS","Course Site":"<a href= 'https://www.fivecolleges.edu/courses/SC/2016/SPRING/MUS/253/01'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(53, 50, 159)","size":10.0},{"label":"MUS-930Y","x":14.0,"y":1.0,"id":"22","attributes":{"Title":"ADVANCED PERFORMANCE","Description":"Spring\n2016\nMusic\n930Y\nSmith College\nAdvanced level.

The course may cover other styles such as: blackface minstrelsy, Tin Pan Alley, folk, jazz, classical or varieties of Latino music. Throughout, we attend to musical aspects of these styles, and connect them to larger historical themes and social issues concerning race, class, gender and the making of \"American\" identity through music.
