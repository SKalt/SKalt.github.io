The public sphere can be understood as a cornerstone of modern democracy; it is, ideally, the sphere in which we engage in debate over the values and practices that should govern our collective life. Yet, the public sphere can also be a mechanism for excluding certain people from participation in the shared culture or politics of the nation, or silencing certain voices or forms of expression. Reading a mix of theoretical and historical works, we reflect on such topics as the role of media and popular culture in creating a sense of public participation, the relationship between public life and consumer capitalism, conflicts surrounding the public expression of sexuality, and the importance of cities to the modern experience of what it means to be in public.\nTopic: Culture, Politics and the Public Sphere.

Over the last decade or so, an energetic activism around disability (including blindness, deafness, mobility impairments, etc.) has been joined by a rich and varied scholarly discourse exploring embodiment and identity. Disability studies has emerged as an exciting field in which scientific, social, political, cultural and economic factors intersect. This one credit course introduces this field of inquiry through a series of lectures that address disability from the perspectives of social policy, history, literary and artistic representation, and cultural and political theory. May be repeated twice for credit with a different topic.

It introduces students to the growing body of material culture studies and the ways in which historic landscapes, architecture, furniture, textiles, metalwork, ceramics, foodways and domestic environments are interpreted as cultural documents and as historical evidence. Offered on-site at Historic Deerfield (with transportation available from the Smith campus), the course offers students a unique opportunity to study the museum's world-famous collections in a hands-on, interactive setting with curators and historians. Utilizing the disciplines of history, art and architectural history, anthropology, and archaeology, we explore the relationships between objects and ideas and the ways in which items of material culture both individually and collectively convey patterns of everyday life.

It asks: how do we define disability?  Who is disabled?  And what resources do we need to properly study disability?  Together, students investigate: trends in disability activism, histories of medicine and science, conceptions of \"normal\" embodiment, the utility of terms like \"crip\" or \"disabled,\" and the representation of disability in culture.

Drawing on the ever-growing literature on museology, we look critically at the ways that museums-through their policies, programs, architecture and exhibitions-can define regional or national values, shape cultural attitudes and identities, and influence public opinion about both current and historical events. As the course is concerned with both theory and practice, and the intersection of the two, we make use of the rich resources of the Smithsonian as well as other museums in Washington, D.C. Class discussion is balanced with behind-the-scenes visits/field trips to museums, where we speak with dedicated professionals who are engaged in innovative and often challenging work in the nation's capital.

Limited to senior majors. Since the 1960s, \"the underground\" has been imagined as a privileged space of artistic innovation, political radicalism and authentic selfhood. Even today, hip-hop and punk musicians describe themselves as \"underground\" if they wish to emphasize their integrity; it is the place to go to keep things real, to avoid \"selling out,\" to evade being co-opted by the dominant order. But what does it mean to be underground? Where did the underground idea come from? What happens to politics and art when it is imagined as an \"underground\" (as opposed to a mainstream) activity? This course offers a critical history of \"the underground\" from the underground slave railroad of the early 19th century to the punk and hip-hop undergrounds of our own time.

William Dean Howells calls autobiography the \"most democratic province of the republic of letters,\" suggesting that self-writing is broadly accessible in a way that other literary or artistic genres aren't.  Indeed, one needn't have extensive training or funds to tell the story of one's own life.
