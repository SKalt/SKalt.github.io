SPAN-220	This course will introduce students to some of the major intellectual texts of the Spanish Caribbean from the twentieth century to the present.  Through these readings, which include essays, novels and poetry, we will examine the legacy of colonial and post-colonial prejudices and the struggles the people of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico engage as they create a unique sense of nationhood within a global context and interlace their stories into a more complicated context often called Pan-Caribbean.  We will explore the ways in which the Hispanic Caribbean countries are similar, while coming to a nuanced understanding of how recent politics and migratory histories have also rendered them vastly different.  Our analyses will cover issues of language, gender, violence, traumatic memory, dictatorship, and human resilience.  This course will be conducted in Spanish.Requisite: SPAN 199, 211 or 212 or consent of the instructor.  Limited to 15 students.  Spring semester.  Professor Suárez.
