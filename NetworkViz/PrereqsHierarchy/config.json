Some courses have substitutable requirements such as Ecology requiring BIOL-181 or ENST-120, in wich case both requirements are shown.  Some courses might belong to multiple departments, in which case they will be colored by their main department.  \nTry selecting a class by clicking on it or searching it in the search bar: a sidebar will appear with a link to the most recent course page, the text describing the requirements, and a list of all the majors the class counts towards.  \nI haven\u0027t yet included which classes are core requirements of each major, but I believe 99% of prereqs are included in the edges. \n\n",
