In one common understanding, nature is precisely that which stands apart from political dynamics, indicating a world of objective \"facts\" beyond human influence.

This course examines the politics of nature through various lenses of poststructuralist, postcolonial, feminist, and Marxist political theory, ultimately seeking to imagine how nature itself might become a site for transformative democratic practice.
