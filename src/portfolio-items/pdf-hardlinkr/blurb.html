	PDF documents are everywhere since 'PDF' lives up to its name: Portable
	Digital Format.  It can combine raster and vector data in a while preserving
	the publisher's layout in a cartesian system<sup><a class=".sup" href="#sup-1">1</a></sup>.
	PFS may be easy on the eye, but to machines they are much less tractable.
	Unlike HTML, selecting words, images, and blocks of text in PDFs is based on
	spatial coordinates and some embedded "fragment identifier" bookmarks. Still,
	identifying and linking to portions of PDFs is possibe.

	Sometime between 2005-2007, Adobe introduced "PDF Open Parameters" to allow users
	(machine and otherwise) to identify and link to sections of PDFs. The
	general syntax is <code>[URL]#parameter_1=value&parameter2=list,values</code>.
	The best-known and most widely implemented pdf open parameter is
	<code>#page=num</code>.  You may not have known you may specify <code>zoom=percent,x,y</code>
	where x and y are coordinates from the top-left of the page, or <code>highlight=x0,y0,x1,y1</code>
	describing a rectangle to highlight on open. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters.pdf#page=7">Adobe lists</a>
	even more open parameters and a method for combining multiple parameters with
	ampersands.  However, few of these open parameters aside from page and zoom
	are implemented in the browser.  Mozilla, is working to implement
	pdf open parameters, but
	<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/2757">
	    the features seem to have been on the back burner since 2014.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
	That's why I built pdf-hardlinkr, which you can try out
	<a href="./src/pdf-hardlinkr/">here</a>.  It uses a <code>svg</code> overlay
	on top of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js">PDF.js</a>'s
	<code>canvas</code> to highlight a urlencoded point.

    <p>This a nonstandard
	feature and so uses nonstandard urlencoding syntax, but in the future I hope
	to implement further standard PDF Open parameters in a more complete version
	of the PDF.js viewer.

	able to hack together GIS tools to display and query data in pdfs.
