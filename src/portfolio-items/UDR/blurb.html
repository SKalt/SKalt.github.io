<p>In 1985, Leemis and McQueston published an article "<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1986.10475379" target="blank">Univariate Distribution Relationships</a>" in the American Statistician, an <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/000313008X270448" target="blank">update</a> in 2008, and in 2012 they published an interactive version of the chart using <code>area</code> tags.  In 2017, I wrote a short python script to scrape the data contained in the <code>area</code> tags and produce a reuseable and extendable dataset.  The result is <a href="#udr-demo">below.</a></p>
<p>The full visualization can be viewed <a href ="src/univariate_distribution_relationships/visualize/udr_visualization.html">here</a> and the full script and data may be retrieved and reused from <a href="https://github.com/SKalt/univariate_distribution_relationships" target="_blank"> this github repo</a>.  If you do reuse the data, please use the citation below for Leemis et al.'s 2008 or 2012 paper and avoid running the scraper unless neccessary</p>.
<!-- <p>Leemis, his collaborators, and I have collective put decades into creating this. I've contributed my day or so because I hope building tools that allow students to explore the relationships behind mathematical objects is the best way to retain them. In the future, I may write some script to import the graph to neo4j, though using the rneo4j packagge with the csvs should be workable</p> -->
