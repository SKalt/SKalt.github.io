<p>In 1985, Leemis and McQueston published an article "<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1986.10475379" target="blank">Univariate Distribution Relationships</a>" in the American Statistician, an <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/000313008X270448" target="blank">update</a> in 2008, and in 2012 they published an interactive version of the chart using <code>area</code> tags.  In 2017, I wrote a short python script to scrape the data contained in the <code>area</code> tags and produce a reuseable and extendable dataset. The properties of relationships and links I had to copy out by hand.  The result is below.</p>
<p>Leemis, his collaborators, and I have collective put decades into creating this. I've contributed my day or so because I hope building tools that allow students to explore the relationships behind mathematical objects is the best way to retain them. </p><!-- TODO: write well -->
