    Mapbox provides an excellent selection of symbols for map-making with its
    Maki icon set. Unfortunately,
    <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/maki-icons/">their page</a> doesn't provide
    a search function, and doesn't even have text to search with <code>ctrl-f</code>.
    That's why I built a quick Vue app, <a href="./maki-choice/">Maki-Choice</a>
    to help me search and select icons for mapmaking.
