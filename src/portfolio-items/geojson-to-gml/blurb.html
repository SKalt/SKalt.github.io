<p>GeoJSON works: it succinctly describes geometric features in a way both humans and machines can understand. As a consequence, GeoJSON has become one of the leading data formats in GIS, and since it is a species of JSON, it naturally rules online GIS visualization. However, the <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> has mainatined another standard, <abbr title="Geography Markup Language">GML</abbr> since the '90s [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language#History">citation</a>]. I wrote a javascript module to translate GeoJSON to GML to allow web GIS technologies to better talk to older tools that rely on OGC GML, i.e. <a href="http://geoserver.org/">Geoserver</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> and <a hre="http://flexberry.github.io/Leaflet-WFST/">Leaflet-WFST</a> can translate GeoJSON to GML. Both are full-fledged web GIS tools. This is only a string formatting library to translate GeoJSON to GML so that it should plug-and-play in any context.</p>
